1. **What is true between data modeling and the formatting of the data?**
    
    * <mark>The data does not necessarily need to be formatted in a way that represents the data model. Just so long as it can be extrapolated.</mark>
        
    * There is a one to one correspondence between formatting data and data modeling. For every model of data, there is only one way to store the data.
        
    * There is always one specific schema for storing model data that is the best and preferred method for the specific data representation.
        
2. **What is streaming?**
    
    * Using static data stored from a real time source in order to process and guide the application.
        
    * Calculating results using real time data otherwise known as streaming data.
        
    * Using sensors to manipulate the system, such as a smart car being able to drive by itself using sensors to detect road hazards.
        
    * <mark>Utilizing real time data to compute and change the state of an application continuously.</mark>
        
3. **Of the following, what best describes the properties of working with streaming data?**
    
    * <mark>Small time windows for working with data.</mark>
        
    * Always unbounded in sequence, in other words, data is not guaranteed to be in order.
        
    * <mark>Data manipulation is near real time.</mark>
        
    * <mark>Does not ping the source interactively for a response upon receiving the data.</mark>
        
    * <mark>Independent computations that do not rely on previous or future data.</mark>
        
    * Data is always utilized for streaming the application.
        
4. **What is a characteristic of streaming data?**
    
    * Data is finite in size and size determines the time and space of processing the data.
        
    * <mark>Data is unbounded in size but requires only finite time and space to process it.</mark>
        
    * The data is unbounded in size and the size determines the time and space of processing the data.
        
    * The data is finite and requires only finite time and space to process the data.
        
5. **What type of algorithm is required for analyzing streaming data?**
    
    * <mark>Fast and Simple</mark>
        
    * Accurate and Memory Efficient
        
    * Fast and Complex
        
    * Accurate and Consistent
        
6. **What is lambda architecture?**
    
    * A specific hardware architecture for a server made specifically for processing real time data.
        
    * A specific method for processing streaming data using special real time processes.
        
    * <mark>A method to process streaming data by utilizing batch processing and real time processing.</mark>
        
7. **Of the following, which best represents the challenge regarding the size and frequency of data?**
    
    * The size and frequency of the streaming data may be too small.
        
    * <mark>The size and frequency of the streaming data may be sporadic.</mark>
        
    * There may not be data to produce the notion of size and frequency.
        
8. **What is the difference between data lakes and data warehouses?**
    
    * Data lakes contain only files while data warehouses contain only databases.
        
    * <mark>Data lakes house raw data while data warehouses contain pre-formatted data.</mark>
        
    * Data lakes utilize hierarchical systems while data warehouses use object storage.
        
9. **What is schema-on-read?**
    
    * The process where formatted data is given structure when read.
        
    * <mark>Data is stored as raw data until it is read by an application where the application assigns structure.</mark>
        
    * The process where data is pre-formatted prior to being read but the schema is loaded on read.
        
    * Another name for data lakes.
