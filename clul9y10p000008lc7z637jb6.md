## Overview

Looker is a modern data platform in Google Cloud that lets business users analyze and visualize data interactively. LookML developers curate the data used by business users by creating new fields, tables, and views to customize and organize data.

In Looker, LookML developers can use derived tables to create new tables that are not already defined in the underlying database. For example, as a LookML developer, you can create derived tables to summarize details from existing tables, such as order details for each order in an e-commerce dataset.

In this lab, you learn how to create both types of derived tables in LookML: SQL derived and native derived tables.

For this lab, a project called `qwiklabs-ecommerce` has been created for you in LookML. This project is based on a mock e-commerce dataset containing information on orders, products, and users. You can learn more about [LookML modeling](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-intro) in the Looker documentation.

### What you'll do

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Modify an existing LookML project (`qwiklabs-ecommerce`) published by a Looker admin
    
* Create a SQL derived table
    
* Create a native derived table
    
* Join new views for derived tables to an Explore
    
* Test LookML changes in development mode
    
* Use the Explore interface to view changes in the modified LookML project
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have a personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to Looker

1. When ready, click **Start Lab**.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
    Notice your lab credentials in the Lab details pane. You use them to sign in to the Looker instance for this lab.
    
    **Note:** If you use other credentials, you will get **errors or incur charges**.
    
2. Click **Open Looker**.
    
3. Enter the provided Username and Password in the **Email** and **Password** fields.
    
    Username:
    
    ```apache
    looker-developer@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    Password:
    
    ```apache
    YyzQk8yhmFv01Oo37BLSHrLjW4Iparf49u9KUFmqPck=
    ```
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials from the Lab Details pane on this page. Do not use your Google Cloud Skills Boost credentials. If you have a personal Looker account, do not use it for this lab.
    
4. Click **Log In**.
    
    After a successful login, you see the Looker instance for this lab.
    

## Task 1. Create a SQL derived table summarizing details for each order

In LookML, you can define derived tables using either SQL queries to define a SQL derived table or Explore queries to define a native derived table.

In this task, you write a SQL query to define a new SQL derived table that summarizes details for each order: order ID, user ID, number of items, and the total cost of items ordered. Then, you create a new view file for the SQL derived table in the `qwiklabs-ecommerce` project.

### Define a new derived table using a SQL query

1. First, on the bottom left of the Looker User Interface, click the toggle button to enter **Development mode**.
    

![Development Mode toggle](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/uUCbNuedSCOYQmL%2BIubjqvusmGAeS7Wjj3f6xByL174%3D align="left")

2. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click **Develop &gt; SQL Runner**.
    
3. In the **SQL Query** window, add the following query:
    

```apache
SELECT
  order_items.order_id AS order_id
  ,order_items.user_id AS user_id
  ,COUNT(*) AS order_item_count
  ,SUM(order_items.sale_price) AS order_revenue
FROM cloud-training-demos.looker_ecomm.order_items
GROUP BY order_id, user_id
LIMIT 10
```

In this example, the desired query selects the `order_id` and `user_id`, counts the number of items associated with each order, and then sums the price of those items.

Specifically, the **COUNT** clause is counting the number of individual order item IDs (the primary key of the `order_items` table), and the **SUM** clause is totaling the `sale_price` of the order item IDs.

The **GROUP BY** clause is used to group the results by `order_id` and `user_id`, and the **LIMIT** clause is used to limit the results, as we only need to review a subset of records to ensure that our query is working successfully.

4. Verify that your query resembles the following:
    

![SQL Query box](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ZCnFTp2cQwzNmTcTlWbjwt%2FOK7mbr3KK0CZjHYYkDsM%3D align="left")

5. Click **Run** to see the results.
    

![Results table with 10 rows of data below four column headings: order_id, user_id, order_item_count, and order_revenue](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9MX7XqIwd4igTdOEcTEMPwty4uq9E2vIQ%2FCt3t41z6U%3D align="left")

In this example, the query is indeed returning the order ID, user ID, and number of items associated with each order as well as the total revenue from each order.

Notice that the **LIMIT** clause is used to reduce the amount of data returned during this test; you will remove the **LIMIT** clause in an upcoming step when you create a new view file for the SQL derived table.

### Create a new view file for the SQL derived table

1. Click **Settings** () next to **Run** (top right of the page), and select **Add to Project**.
    
2. For **Project**, select `qwiklabs-ecommerce`.
    
3. For **View Name**, type: `order_details`.
    
4. Click **Add**.
    

You are redirected to the Looker IDE to review the newly created view file for your SQL derived table.

Notice that the new view file for the `order_details` view has been created outside of the `views` folder. It is a best practice to keep the view files organized in the project.

5. Click on the arrow next to **views** to see the list of views.
    
6. Click `order_details.view` and drag it under the **views** folder.
    
7. Click `order_details.view` to see the view file for the SQL derived table.
    

Looker auto-generates a dimension for each column in the **SELECT** clause of the SQL query as well as a new count measure. In the next steps, you modify the view file to remove the **LIMIT** clause which is no longer desired, hide the new count measure, and add a primary key for the view.

8. Delete the code line for `LIMIT 10` from the sql parameter.
    

As highlighted previously, Looker auto-generates a count measure along with the dimensions used in the derived table. Sometimes this auto-generated count measure is not valuable, if you already have a count in another view that provides the same number.

In this example, the auto-generated count measure is counting the order IDs, and there is already a count of orders in the `order_items` view.

You can delete or hide the count measure using the `hidden: yes` parameter. Hiding the measure is a good idea if you would like to retain it for validation if this count is the same as another count.

9. In the **measure: count** definition, add a new line before `type: count`, and type: `hidden: yes`.
    

A final best practice is to make sure that the new view has a primary key.

In this example, you can add the `primary_key: yes` parameter to the **order\_id** dimension, which is the central organizing ID of this view that provides details about each individual order.

10. In the **dimension: order\_id** definition, add a new line before `type: number`, and type: `primary_key: yes`.
    

The new view called `order_details` is now ready for you to create new dimensions and measures, join it to the explore in the model file, and/or finish out the Git workflow to send your changes to production.

11. Click **Save Changes**.
    

![order_details.view tabbed page, along with the File Browser panel.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XG6OfXYbtYxpnp6d12%2FsL2ygzr0J5vYsh5Qg0TGAz%2BA%3D align="left")

### Commit changes and deploy to production

1. Click **Validate LookML** and then click **Commit Changes & Push**.
    
2. Add a commit message and click **Commit**.
    
3. Lastly, click **Deploy to Production**.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## Task 2. Create a native derived table summarizing details for each order

In contrast to SQL derived tables, native derived tables, or NDTs, are expressed entirely in LookML. Native derived tables are useful because they embody that essential LookML principle of reusability. They allow you to inherit already existing dimensions, measures, and even Explores and join logic.

Since you’re minimizing the number of “hard-coded” database references, this makes your code much more maintainable in the long run.

For example, think about the `order_details` SQL derived table from the previous section. The SQL included a **COUNT** of order\_items and a **SUM** of sale\_price. However, your `order_items` view already has measures for `order_item_count` and `total_revenue`. Rather than creating a new SQL derived table, you can use existing dimensions and measures to easily define a new NDT.

In this section, you will recreate the SQL derived table from the previous example, now as a native derived table. The easiest way to create a native derived table is through an Explore. You will use the **Order Items Explore** to create your desired native derived table that contains the details for each order: order ID, user ID, number of items, and the total cost of items ordered.

### Define a new native derived table from an Explore query

1. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click **Explore**.
    
2. Under **E-Commerce Training**, click **Order Items**.
    
3. Click the arrow next to **Order Items**.
    

The available dimensions and measures will be listed in the data panel for Order Items. Remember that the Explore will automatically generate a valid, performant SQL query for you.

4. Under **Order Items &gt; Dimensions**, click **Order ID** and **User ID**.
    
5. Under **Order Items &gt;** **Measures**, click **Order Count** and **Total Revenue**.
    
6. Click **Run** to see the results.
    

![Query results table, which includes rows for the order items' ID, user ID, count, and total revenue.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/3vo%2BiyJSpCA%2BSrpv3Sc8busT6mkqgztZNxJZlsXS%2ByQ%3D align="left")

Take a moment to review the results of the query to ensure that it is returning the desired results. In this example, the request is correctly returning the Order ID, User ID, and number of items associated with each order, as well as the total revenue from each order.

7. Click **Settings** () next to **Run** (top right of page), and select **Get LookML**.
    
8. Click on **Derived Table** and copy the LookML code to your computer clipboard. You will paste this LookML code into a new view file for this native derived table.
    

![Get LookML Derived Table  code](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hGYPctc%2F4b9j8WHZYsoTDkxXofaZhlcngGc%2F5JrewmY%3D align="left")

### Create a new view file for the native derived table

1. Open a new Looker window in a new tab.
    
2. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click the **Develop** tab and then select the `qwiklabs-ecommerce` LookML project.
    
3. Next to **File Browser**, click **Add file or folder** ().
    
4. Select **Create View**.
    
5. For **file name**, type: `order_details_summary`.
    
6. Click **Create**.
    

Notice again that the new view file for the `order_details_summary` view has been created outside of the **views** folder.

7. Click on the arrow next to **views** to see the list of views.
    
8. Click `order_details_summary.view` and drag it under the **views** folder.
    
9. Click `order_details_summary.view` to see the view file for the native derived table.
    
10. Delete all of the auto-generated LookML in the view file.
    
11. Paste the LookML code you copied for the native derived table.
    
12. Replace the auto-generated view name (e.g. `add_a_unique_name_1623275538`) with: `order_details_summary`. Your file should resemble the following:
    

![order_details_summary.view page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/x9WnlxAXGqPzWEZMz8T%2BqNP%2F%2F2BV24hrp%2B0gHJ3hGQ4%3D align="left")

Notice that Looker makes a suggestion to include the model file but the lines are commented out. It is best practice to leave the line for the model file commented out. The reason is that model files almost always include other files, so if you have lots of files including each other, then you risk creating circular dependencies in your model. This can cause syntax validation errors.

The new view called `order_details_summary` is now ready for you to create new dimensions and measures, join it to the explore in the model file, and/or finish out the Git workflow to send your changes to production.

13. Click **Save Changes**.
    

For now, you will not join it to the explore, you will do this for the SQL derived table.

### Commit changes and deploy to production

1. Click **Validate LookML** and then click **Commit Changes & Push**.
    
2. Add a commit message and click **Commit**.
    
3. Lastly, click **Deploy to Production**.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

**Check my progress**

## Task 3. Join a new view to an Explore

In this section, review and test the new derived table. You will first join it to the `order_items` explore definition in the model file, and then use the **Order Items** Explore to review what business users would see if you pushed the changes to production.

Note that while you will not complete these last steps for the native derived table, the process of joining the view to an explore is the same whether the view is created for a SQL derived or native derived table.

### Join the view for the SQL derived table

1. From the same page, click on the `training_ecommerce.model` file inside of the **model** folder to modify its contents.
    
2. Locate the `explore: order_items` definition. Notice that there are several joins already defined such as the one for the **users** view.
    

![training_ecommerce.model page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/wS0ZZWYF3PY8kedVzGCQfGVzLdoDRij9Hup1BcNhmDg%3D align="left")

3. In the `explore: order_items` definition, above the existing join for **users**, add a new join for `order_details` by specifying:
    

```apache
join: order_details {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${order_items.order_id} = ${order_details.order_id};;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
```

The `sql_on` parameter identifies the join field as `order_id`. The `relationship` parameter identifies that there are potentially many instances of an `order_id` in **order\_items** but only one instance of each `order_id` in **order\_details**, which is organized as one summary row for each order.

4. Click **Save Changes**.
    

![training_ecommerce.model page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/muReAPF3OHqtA3njMUujX5PYD4fpuwRjxJi5Dz%2Fdqe0%3D align="left")

### Review the data and generated SQL from the SQL derived table in the Explore

1. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click **Explore**.
    
2. Under **E-Commerce Training**, click **Order Items**.
    
3. Click the arrow next to **Order Details**.
    
4. Under **Order Details &gt; Dimensions**, click **Order ID**, **Order Item Count**, **Order Revenue**, and **User ID**.
    
5. Click **Run** to see the results.
    
6. Click on the **SQL** tab to see the SQL query generated by Looker.
    

![SQL tabbed page displaying the generated SQL query](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/cUt%2BJHZNpFW%2Fr%2F33FUKWh7b2zSivZUF4YCl2r8G5UvE%3D align="left")

Notice the common table expression (CTE) identified by a **WITH** clause. This native derived table is considered ephemeral because it is generated at run-time as a CTE, rather than stored in the underlying database.

Derived tables can also be persisted, which means that they are stored in the underlying database. For more information on persistent derived tables, review the [Creating persistent derived tables (PDTs) documentation](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/derived-tables#creating_persistent_derived_tables).

In the next section, we will explore how to persist derived tables, so that they can be written back to the database.

7. Navigate back to the `training_ecommerce.model` file.
    

### Commit changes and deploy to production

1. Click **Validate LookML** and then click **Commit Changes & Push**.
    
2. Add a commit message and click **Commit**.
    
3. Lastly, click **Deploy to Production**.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## Task 4. Persist a derived table

So far, the derived tables that you have explored in the examples have been ephemeral, meaning that Looker produces CTEs (or temp tables) for them in the Explore queries.

Now you will learn about the other type of existence for derived tables: persistent. Persistent derived tables, or PDTs, are written to and stored in the connected database. The steps to persist a derived table are the same whether it is a SQL derived or native derived table.

As mentioned previously, the benefit in persisting derived tables is that they are ready to go when business users need them, and therefore reduce query runtimes. The downsides are that they take up storage space in your database (which may correlate to cost), and they are more rigid.

To persist a derived table, you must use one or two of these parameters in the definition:

* `datagroup_trigger` uses a datagroup, or caching policy configured in the model. If datagroups are defined in the model, then this is the best practice for persisting derived tables.
    
* `sql_trigger_value` uses a pre-written SELECT statement that returns one value. Looker sends that SELECT statement to the database repeatedly, and when it discovers the result has changed, it takes this as a cue to rebuild the PDT.
    
* `persist_for` instructs the PDT to stay up for a set duration, such as “1 hour” or “4 hours”.
    

However, it is important to note that `persist_for` does not have any rebuild logic, so the PDT would not get updated during that time. In addition, once time is up, the PDT is dropped, and it doesn’t come back until a business user needs it for a query.

Because the primary benefit of PDTs is having data readily available to minimize query runtimes, it is recommended that you use `persist_for` in conjunction with `sql_trigger_value` to ensure that data updates are captured in the PDT, or simply use `datagroup_trigger` or `sql_trigger_value`.

### Persist the native derived table

In this task, you persist the native derived table using the parameter **datagroup\_trigger**, which rebuilds a persistent derived table based on a pre-defined datagroup (cache policy) in the model file.

For the native derived table named `order_details_summary`, you add `training_ecommerce_default_datagroup` as the **datagroup\_trigger**, so that the persistent derived table will rebuild using the rule provided in `training_ecommerce_default_datagroup` within **training\_ecommerce.model** to rebuild all objects defined in the model every hour.

1. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click the **Develop** tab and then select the `qwiklabs-ecommerce` LookML project.
    
2. Click on the arrow next to **views** to see the list of views.
    
3. Click `order_details_summary.view` to see the view file for the native derived table.
    
4. In the `derived_table` definition, add a new line after the closing bracket (`}`) for `explore_source: order_items`, and paste:
    

```apache
datagroup_trigger: training_ecommerce_default_datagroup
```

5. Click **Save Changes**. Your file should resemble the following:
    

![order_details_summary.view page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/zxZhD9OfP0dhl6uFm0JWAf8vTSLcIxfu4J9I2DjGEVA%3D align="left")

### Review the generated SQL for the persistent derived table in the Explore

1. On the **Looker navigation menu**, click **Explore**.
    
2. Under **E-Commerce Training**, click **Order Items**.
    
3. Click the arrow next to **Order Details**.
    
4. Under **Order Details &gt; Dimensions**, click **Order ID**, **Order Item Count**, **Order Revenue**, and **User ID**.
    
5. Click **Run** to see the results.
    
6. Click on the **SQL** tab to see the SQL query generated by Looker.
    

![The highlighted SQL tabbed page displaying the generated SQL query](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/gvekjWPTlciLggRWEFgfI758Fn%2Bf32NtkouqSqcWWm4%3D align="left")

Now that the derived table has been persisted, the previous CTE identified by the **WITH** clause is no longer present and has been replaced by a **SELECT** statement querying fields from the `order_details_summary` persistent derived table.

7. Navigate back to the `order_details_summary` file.
    

### Commit changes and deploy to production

1. Click **Validate LookML** and then click **Commit Changes & Push**.
    
2. Add a commit message and click **Commit**.
    
3. Lastly, click **Deploy to Production**.
