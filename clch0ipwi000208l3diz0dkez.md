OpenForm is an open-source form builder made with Laravel, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and more. You can self-host this application or use the cloud-based hosted version to create forms that you can share anywhere on the web using a no-code form builder:

The main features of the form builder application include the following:

* No-code form builder, with an infinite number of fields & submissions
    
* Text inputs, Date inputs, URL inputs, Phone inputs, Email inputs, Checkboxes, Select and Multi-Select inputs, Number Inputs, Star-ratings, File uploads & more
    
* Embed anywhere (on your website, on your Notion page, etc)
    
* Email notifications (for both form owner & form respondents)
    
* Hidden fields
    
* Form passwords
    
* URL form pre-fill
    
* Slack integration
    
* Webhooks
    
* Form logic
    
* Customize colors, add images, or even some custom code
    
* Captcha form protection
    
* Form closing date
    
* Limit the number of submissions allowed
    
* And much more!
    

The other side of why we wanted to share OpnForm, is that it is an open-source Laravel application. It is a full application for which you can browse the entire source code, including PestPHP testing examples, Vue components, a Vue SPA, Tailwind CSS, and more.
