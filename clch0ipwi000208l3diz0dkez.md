# OpnForm is an Open-source Form Builder Made With Laravel

OpenForm is an open-source form builder made with Laravel, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and more. You can self-host this application or use the cloud-based hosted version to create forms that you can share anywhere on the web using a no-code form builder:
