    * <mark>True</mark>
        
    * False
        
2. **Let's imagine you code a custom hook, called for example useNext, on a separate file named useNext.js**
    
    **What's the minimum requirement for the custom useNext hook to be a valid hook?**
    
    * The custom hook should always return a value
        
    * <mark>The custom hook should use at least one built-in React hook</mark>
        
    * The custom hook should always receive a parameter
        
3. **In the previous exercise, you were given a task to create your own custom hook,** `usePrevious`**. What was being returned from the** `usePrevious` **function declaration?**
    
    * <mark>ref.current</mark>
