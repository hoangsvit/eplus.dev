## Overview

The [Google APIs Explorer](http://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/) is a tool that lets you explore various Google API methods without writing code. With the APIs Explorer you can:

* Browse quickly through available **APIs** and versions.
    
* See **methods** available for each API and what **parameters** they support along with inline documentation.
    
* Execute requests for any method and see responses in **real time**.
    
* Make **authenticated and authorized** API calls.
    
* Search across all **services**, **methods**, and your **recent requests** to quickly find what you are looking for.
    

The APIs Explorer uses its own [API keys](https://developers.google.com/console/help/using-keys) whenever it makes a request. When you use the APIs Explorer to make a request, it displays the request syntax, which includes a placeholder labeled `{YOUR_API_KEY}`. If you want to make the same request in your application, you need to replace this placeholder with your own API key.

### Objectives

* Create a Cloud Storage bucket.
    
* Upload an image to Cloud Storage and make it public.
    
* Make a request to the Vision API with that image.
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-b179b49d2382@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    rBNYlkXmqcF7
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

## Task 1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket

1. In the Cloud console, go to **Cloud Storage** &gt; **Buckets**.
    
2. Click **Create bucket**.
    
3. Give your bucket a unique name. Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name - the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible. For example, `qwiklabs-gcp-01-0f18f214c310`\-bucket.
    
4. Click **Choose how to control access to objects**.
    
5. Uncheck **Enforce public access prevention on this bucket**.
    
6. Select **Fine-grained** Access control.
    
7. Click **Create**.
