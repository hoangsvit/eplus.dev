## Overview

Cloud Shell provides you with command-line access to computing resources hosted on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell is a Debian-based virtual machine with a persistent 5-GB home directory, which makes it easy for you to manage your Google Cloud projects and resources. The `gcloud` command-line tool and other utilities you need are pre-installed in Cloud Shell, which allows you to get up and running quickly.

In this hands-on lab, you learn how to connect to computing resources hosted on Google Cloud via Cloud Shell with the `gcloud` tool.

You are encouraged to type the commands themselves, which reinforces the core concepts. Many labs will include a code block that contains the required commands. You can easily copy and paste the commands from the code block into the appropriate places during the lab.

### What you'll do

* Practice using `gcloud` commands.
    
* Connect to compute services hosted on Google Cloud.
    

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with standard Linux text editors such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`.
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-2424e8120303@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    418xflt2ADG0
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-00-24e9cfc25db6`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-00-24e9cfc25db6
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-04-2424e8120303@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-00-24e9cfc25db6
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

After Cloud Shell is activated, you can use the command line to invoke the Cloud SDK `gcloud` tool or other tools available on the virtual machine instance. Later in the lab, you will use your `$HOME` directory, which is used in persistent disk storage to store files across projects and between Cloud Shell sessions. Your `$HOME` directory is private to you and cannot be accessed by other users.

## Task 1. Configuring your environment

In this section, you'll learn about aspects of the development environment that you can adjust.

### Understanding regions and zones

Certain [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances) resources live in regions or zones. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more zones. For example, the `us-central1` region denotes a region in the Central United States that has zones `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c`, and `us-central1-f`. The following table shows zones in their respective regions:

| **Western US** | **Central US** | **Eastern US** | **Western Europe** | **Eastern Asia** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| us-west1-a | us-central1-a | us-east1-b | europe-west1-b | asia-east1-a |
| us-west1-b | us-central1-b | us-east1-c | europe-west1c | asia-east1-b |
| \- | us-central1-c | us-east1-d | europe-west1-d | aisia-east1-c |
| \- | us-central1-f | \- | \- | \- |

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as *zonal* resources. Virtual machine instances and persistent disks live in a zone. If you want to attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP address.

**Note:** Learn more about regions and zones and see a complete list in Google Cloud Compute Engine's [Regions and Zones documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/).

1. Set the region to `europe-west1`
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1
    ```
    
2. To view the project region setting, run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config get-value compute/region
    ```
    
3. Set the zone to `europe-west1-d`:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-d
    ```
    
4. To view the project zone setting, run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config get-value compute/zone
    ```
    

### Finding project information

1. Copy your project ID to your clipboard or text editor. The project ID is listed in 2 places:
    
    * In the Cloud Console, on the Dashboard, under **Project info**. (Click **Navigation menu** (
        
        ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
        
        ), and then click **Cloud overview &gt; Dashboard**.)
        
    * On the lab tab near your username and password.
        
2. In Cloud Shell, run the following `gcloud` command, to view the project id for your project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config get-value project
    ```
    
3. In Cloud Shell, run the following `gcloud` command to view details about the project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute project-info describe --project $(gcloud config get-value project)
    ```
    
    Find the zone and region metadata values in the output. You'll use the zone (`google-compute-default-zone`) from the output later in this lab.
    
    **Note:** When the `google-compute-default-region` and `google-compute-default-zone` keys and values are missing from the output, no default zone or region is set. The output includes other useful information regarding your project. Take some time to explore this in more detail.
    

### Setting environment variables

Environment variables define your environment and help save time when you write scripts that contain APIs or executables.

1. Create an environment variable to store your Project ID:
    
    ```apache
    export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
    ```
    
2. Create an environment variable to store your Zone:
    
    ```apache
    export ZONE=$(gcloud config get-value compute/zone)
    ```
    
3. To verify that your variables were set properly, run the following commands:
    
    ```apache
    echo -e "PROJECT ID: $PROJECT_ID\nZONE: $ZONE"
    ```
    
    If the variables were set correctly, the echo commands will output your Project ID and Zone.
    

### Creating a virtual machine with the gcloud tool

Use the `gcloud` tool to create a new virtual machine (VM) instance.

1. To create your VM, run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type e2-medium --zone $ZONE
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/qwiklabs-gcp-04-326fae68bc3d/zones/us-east1-c/instances/gcelab2].
    NAME     ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP   STATUS
    gcelab2  europe-west1-d     e2-medium               10.128.0.2   34.67.152.90  RUNNING
    ```
    
    **Command details**
    
    * `gcloud compute` allows you to manage your Compute Engine resources in a format that's simpler than the Compute Engine API.
        
    * `instances create` creates a new instance.
        
    * `gcelab2` is the name of the VM.
        
    * The `--machine-type` flag specifies the machine type as *e2-medium*.
        
    * The `--zone` flag specifies where the VM is created.
        
    * If you omit the `--zone` flag, the `gcloud` tool can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, such as `machine type` and `image`, are set to default values if not specified in the `create` command.
        
    
    #### Test completed task
    
    Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have successfully created a virtual machine with the `gcloud` tool, an assessment score is displayed.
    
    Create a virtual machine with gcloud
    
    **Check my progress**
    
    * To open help for the `create` command, run the following command:
        
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute instances create --help
    ```
    
    **Note:** Press **Enter** or the spacebar to scroll through the help content. To exit the content, type **Q**.
    

### Exploring gcloud commands

The `gcloud` tool offers simple usage guidelines that are available by adding the `-h` flag (for help) onto the end of any `gcloud` command.

1. Run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud -h
    ```
    

You can access more verbose help by appending the `--help` flag onto a command or running the `gcloud help` command.

2. Run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config --help
    ```
    
    To exit type `Q` and hit **Enter**.
    
3. Run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud help config
    ```
    
    The results of the `gcloud config --help` and `gcloud help config` commands are equivalent. Both return long, detailed help.
    
    There are [global flags](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/) in `gcloud` that govern the behavior of commands on a per-invocation level. Flags override any values set in SDK properties.
    
4. View the list of configurations in your environment:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config list
    ```
    
5. To see all properties and their settings:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud config list --all
    ```
    
6. List your components:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud components list
    ```
    
    This command displays the `gcloud` components that are ready for you to use in this lab.
    

## Task 2. Filtering command-line output

The `gcloud` command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for working at the command line. You may want specific information to be displayed.

1. List the compute instance available in the project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute instances list
    ```
    
    **Note:** Having multiple resources deployed in a project is very common. Fortunately `gcloud` has some clever formatting that can help identify specific resources.
    
    **Example Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME: gcelab2
    ZONE: europe-west1-d
    MACHINE_TYPE: e2-medium
    PREEMPTIBLE:
    INTERNAL_IP: 10.142.0.2
    EXTERNAL_IP: 35.237.43.111
    STATUS: RUNNING
    ```
    
2. List the gcelab2 virtual machine:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute instances list --filter="name=('gcelab2')"
    ```
    
    **Example Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME: gcelab2
    ZONE: europe-west1-d
    MACHINE_TYPE: e2-medium
    PREEMPTIBLE:
    INTERNAL_IP: 10.142.0.2
    EXTERNAL_IP: 35.237.43.111
    STATUS: RUNNING
    ```
    

In the above command, you asked `gcloud` to only show the information matching the criteria i.e. a virtual instance name matching the criteria.

**Note:** Your output format may differ from the one provided in the lab manual.

3. List the firewall rules in the project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME                         NETWORK      DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                         DENY  DISABLED
    default-allow-icmp           default      INGRESS    65534     icmp                                False
    default-allow-internal       default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535,icmp        False
    default-allow-rdp            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:3389                            False
    default-allow-ssh            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:22                              False
    dev-net-allow-ssh            dev-network  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22                              False
    serverless-to-vpc-connector  dev-network  INGRESS    1000      icmp,udp:665-666,tcp:667            False
    vpc-connector-egress         dev-network  INGRESS    1000      icmp,udp,tcp                        False
    vpc-connector-health-check   dev-network  INGRESS    1000      tcp:667                             False
    vpc-connector-to-serverless  dev-network  EGRESS     1000      icmp,udp:665-666,tcp:667            False
    ```
    
4. List the firewall rules for the default network:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="network='default'"
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME                         NETWORK      DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                         DENY  DISABLED
    default-allow-icmp           default      INGRESS    65534     icmp                                False
    default-allow-internal       default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535,icmp        False
    default-allow-rdp            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:3389                            False
    default-allow-ssh            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:22                              False
    ```
    
5. List the firewall rules for the default network where the allow rule matches an ICMP rule:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="NETWORK:'default' AND ALLOW:'icmp'"
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME                         NETWORK      DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                         DENY  DISABLED
    default-allow-icmp           default      INGRESS    65534     icmp                                False
    default-allow-internal       default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535,icmp        False
    ```
    

## Task 3. Connecting to your VM instance

`gcloud compute` makes connecting to your instances easy. The `gcloud compute ssh` command provides a wrapper around SSH, which takes care of authentication and the mapping of instance names to IP addresses.

1. To connect to your VM with SSH, run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
    WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
    WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
    WARNING: [/usr/bin/ssh-keygen] will be executed to generate a key.
    This tool needs to create the directory
    [/home/gcpstaging306_student/.ssh] before being able to generate SSH Keys.
    ```
    
    ```apache
    Do you want to continue? (Y/n)
    ```
    
2. To continue, type **Y**.
    
    ```apache
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)
    ```
    
3. To leave the passphrase empty, press **Enter** twice.
    
    **Note:** You have connected to the virtual machine created earlier in the lab. Did you notice how the command prompt changed?
    
    The prompt now says something similar to **sa\_107021519685252337470@gcelab2**.
    
    * The reference before the **@** indicates the account being used.
        
    * After the **@** sign indicates the host machine being accessed.
        
4. Install `nginx` web server on to virtual machine:
    
    ```apache
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx
    ```
    
5. You don't need to do anything here. To disconnect from SSH and exit the remote shell, run the following command:
    
    ```apache
    exit
    ```
    
    You should be back at your project's command prompt.
    

## Task 4. Updating the firewall

When using compute resources such as virtual machines, it's important to understand the associated firewall rules.

1. List the firewall rules for the project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME                         NETWORK      DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                         DENY  DISABLED
    default-allow-icmp           default      INGRESS    65534     icmp                                False
    default-allow-internal       default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535,icmp        False
    default-allow-rdp            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:3389                            False
    default-allow-ssh            default      INGRESS    65534     tcp:22                              False
    dev-net-allow-ssh            dev-network  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22                              False
    serverless-to-vpc-connector  dev-network  INGRESS    1000      icmp,udp:665-666,tcp:667            False
    vpc-connector-egress         dev-network  INGRESS    1000      icmp,udp,tcp                        False
    vpc-connector-health-check   dev-network  INGRESS    1000      tcp:667                             False
    vpc-connector-to-serverless  dev-network  EGRESS     1000      icmp,udp:665-666,tcp:667            False
    ```
    
    From the above you can see there are two networks available. The `default` network is where the virtual machine `gcelab2` is located.
    
2. Try to access the nginx service running on the `gcelab2` virtual machine.
    
    **Note:** Communication with the virtual machine will fail as it does not have an appropriate firewall rule. The **nginx** web server is expecting to communicate on **tcp:80**. To get communication working you need to:
    
    * Add a tag to the gcelab2 virtual machine
        
    * Add a firewall rule for http traffic
        
3. Add a tag to the virtual machine:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute instances add-tags gcelab2 --tags http-server,https-server
    ```
    
4. Update the firewall rule to allow:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-http --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http-server
    ```
    
    Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.
    
    Update the firewall
    
    **Check my progress**
    
5. List the firewall rules for the project:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter=ALLOW:'80'
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME                NETWORK  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW   DENY  DISABLED
    default-allow-http  default  INGRESS    1000      tcp:80        False
    ```
    
6. Verify communication is possible for http to the virtual machine:
    
    ```apache
    curl http://$(gcloud compute instances list --filter=name:gcelab2 --format='value(EXTERNAL_IP)')
    ```
    

You will see the default `nginx` output.

## Task 5. Viewing the system logs

Viewing logs is essential to understanding the working of your project. Use `gcloud` to access the different logs available on Google Cloud.

1. View the available logs on the system:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud logging logs list
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/GCEGuestAgent
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/OSConfigAgent
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/autoscaler.googleapis.com%2Fstatus_change
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fautoscaler
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Finstance_group_manager_events
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fshielded_vm_integrity
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/run.googleapis.com%2Fstderr
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/run.googleapis.com%2Fstdout
    ```
    
2. View the logs that relate to compute resources:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud logging logs list --filter="compute"
    ```
    
    **Output**:
    
    ```apache
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fautoscaler
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Finstance_group_manager_events
    NAME: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-4b75909db302/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fshielded_vm_integrity
    ```
    
3. Read the logs related to the resource type of `gce_instance`:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance" --limit 5
    ```
    
4. Read the logs for a specific virtual machine:
    
    ```apache
    gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance AND labels.instance_name='gcelab2'" --limit 5
    ```
    

## Task 6. Testing your understanding

The following multiple-choice question should reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts.

Three basic ways to interact with Google Cloud services and resources are:

* Cloud Console
    
* GStreamer
    
* GLib
    
* Command-line interface
    
* Client libraries
