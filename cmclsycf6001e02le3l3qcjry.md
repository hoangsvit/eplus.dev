This season has been an incredible journey—packed with challenges, skill-building, and moments of growth. We’re proud of everything you’ve achieved and hope these accomplishments take your cloud skills to the next level in your career.

If you’ve earned **20 or more Arcade Points**, congratulations—you’ve unlocked access to the **Arcade Prize Counter**!

### **Important Reminders Before Prize Redemption**

Here are some key points to ensure a smooth prize redemption process:

**Check Your Email ID**:  
Ensure your registered email ID is correct. This is where the **Prize Counter access link** will be sent.

**Subscription Requirement**:  
Make sure you were subscribed to the **Skills Boost Arcade** during the season. Only subscribed participants will receive prize emails and updates.

**Arcade Points Format**:  
Arcade points are always displayed as whole numbers—you’ll never see them in decimals.

**Tier Status**:  
Confirm that you’ve reached the required Tier to redeem your prizes. For example, you need at least **20 points** for Tier 1 (Arcade Novice). If you haven’t reached the required points, you won’t be able to access the Prize Counter.

**Bonus Points Eligibility**:  
To qualify for bonus points, you needed to complete the RSVP form at the start of the Facilitator Program, providing your email ID and associated public profile. If the form wasn’t submitted or the details didn’t match, facilitator points were not awarded. You also have received the Bonus points mail on you registered mail.

**Resolving Discrepancies**:  
There’s no official Arcade Points calculator approved by the team. If you notice discrepancies, it’s likely due to unofficial calculators. Manually calculate your points using the **Points System**:

* **1 Arcade Monthly/Certification Game Badge** = 1 Arcade Point
    
* **1 Arcade Weekly Trivia Badge** = 1 Arcade Point
    
* **1 Arcade Special Edition Badge** = 2 Arcade Points
    
* **2 Skill Badges** = 1 Arcade Point
    

Special Edition Badges for the current season include:  
*Arcade Skills Resolve, Arcade Love Beyond Query, Color Your Skills, Tech Care, NetworSkills, and Learn-a-Thon.*

If there’s still an issue with your points, the team will contact you. If you don’t hear from them, your points tally is accurate.

**Review Prize Rules**:  
It’s a good idea to review the **Prize Counter Rules and FAQs** to avoid surprises during redemption.

**What’s Next?**  
The **Prize Counter** is your chance to redeem all those hard-earned Arcade Points for some amazing swags. Stay tuned for the official opening date and keep an eye on your email inbox for your unique access link. Most probably in First or Second week of July, 2025.

Let’s celebrate your achievements and gear up for redemption!

If you have any questions or concerns, drop a comment below—I’m happy to help.
