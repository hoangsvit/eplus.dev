### Week 2: Serverless Event Driven Architectures

You start this week with an introduction to event-driven architectures (EDAs). You learn about AWS services that you can use for messaging, such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon EventBridge. Finally, you explore how to use AWS Step Functions to help you build applications that implement a workflow.

Learning Objectives

---

* Describe two different application integration designs: the REST API and EDA.
    
* Differentiate messaging use cases for Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS.
    
* Use Step Functions to create a workflow that coordinates multiple AWS services.
    

---

1. **Which of the following are benefits of using event driven architecture patterns?** (Select THREE.)
    
    * <mark>Scalability</mark>
        
    * <mark>The use of loosely coupled components</mark>
        
    * A single event is processed by a single consumer
        
    * Event producers and event consumers must both use the same programming language
        
    * <mark>The ability to process events in real time</mark>
        
    * The use of synchronous protocols to deliver a response to a subscriber after a request.
        
2. **Which component generates an event, including events from user interfaces and backend systems?**
    
    * Event routers
        
    * Event consumers
        
    * <mark>Event producers</mark>
        
    * Amazon EventBridge
        
3. **Which service can sort events and route the messages automatically to the correct target?**
    
    * Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
        
    * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
        
    * <mark>Amazon EventBridge</mark>
        
    * Amazon CloudWatch
