### LESSON 1: INTRODUCTION TO MongoDB ATLAS, THE DEVELOPER DATA PLATFORM

1. **Which of the following is something that you can do with MongoDB Atlas? (Select all that apply.)**  
    <mark>A.</mark> Store your data with MongoDB's multi-cloud, global service.  
    B. Add search functionality to your application, like a search bar.  
    <mark>C.</mark> Write and host a full application in a managed cloud environment.  
    <mark>D.</mark> Query across multiple Atlas clusters to get a holistic view of your data. E. None of the above.  
    **The correct options are:**
    
    A. Store your data with MongoDB's multi-cloud, global service. C. Write and host a full application in a managed cloud environment. D. Query across multiple Atlas clusters to get a holistic view of your data.
    
    Explanation:
    
    A. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service that allows you to store your data in a multi-cloud, global environment.
    
    C. MongoDB Atlas provides a managed cloud environment, allowing you to write and host a full application with ease.
    
    D. MongoDB Atlas allows you to query across multiple clusters, enabling you to get a holistic view of your data across different Atlas clusters.
    
    So, the correct options are <mark>A, C, and D</mark>.

2. Which of the following statements are true about MongoDB Atlas Clusters? (Select all that apply.)  
    <mark>A.</mark> A MongoDB Atlas Cluster is a group of servers that are connected via a network that hold copies of your data.  
    B. Once you set up and configure your MongoDB Atlas Cluster, you cannot make any changes to cloud-provider, region, or cluster tier.  
    <mark>C.</mark> MongoDB Atlas Clusters can be deployed globally in a single geographical region or across multiple geographical regions, depending on the cluster tier.  
    <mark>D.</mark> Dedicated clusters provide access to all Atlas features. E. None of the above.  
    **The correct statements are:**
    
    A. A MongoDB Atlas Cluster is a group of servers that are connected via a network that holds copies of your data.
    
    C. MongoDB Atlas Clusters can be deployed globally in a single geographical region or across multiple geographical regions, depending on the cluster tier.
    
    D. Dedicated clusters provide access to all Atlas features.
    
    Explanation:
    
    A. A MongoDB Atlas Cluster is indeed a group of servers that are connected via a network, and these servers hold copies of your data for redundancy and fault tolerance.
    
    C. MongoDB Atlas allows you to deploy clusters globally, either in a single geographical region or across multiple regions, depending on your requirements and the chosen cluster tier.
    
    D. Dedicated clusters in MongoDB Atlas provide access to all features, offering a more comprehensive set of capabilities compared to shared clusters.
    
    So, the correct options are <mark>A, C, and D</mark>.

### LESSON 2: CREATING AND DEPLOYING AN ATLAS CLUSTER

1. Which of the following cloud providers are available on a free-tier shared Atlas cluster? (Select all that apply.)  
    <mark>A.</mark> Amazon Web Services  
    <mark>B.</mark> Google Cloud

# [**Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas, the Developer Data Platform**](https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/getting-started-with-mongodb-atlas)

## **Unit Overview**

In this unit, you’ll learn about Atlas, MongoDB’s multi-cloud developer data platform. First, you will become familiar with the tools and services that are available to you when you set up an Atlas account. You’ll also learn about how MongoDB Atlas stores and hosts data with Atlas clusters, a global, multi-cloud database service. Finally, you’ll set up a free Atlas account, launch your own free-tier Atlas cluster, and load sample data into your cluster so that you can get started with using MongoDB Atlas and the developer data platform.

## **Prerequisites**

There are no prerequisites for this unit.

## **Lessons in This Unit**

* Lesson 01: Introduction to MongoDB Atlas, the Developer Data Platform
    
* Lesson 02: Creating and Deploying an Atlas Cluster
