[Laravel Comments](https://laravel-comments.com/) is a premium comments package for applications using PHP 8.1+ and Laravel 9+ by Spatie. Using this package, you can create and associate comments with Eloquent models.

At the time of launch, Laravel Comments' main features include:

A beautiful Livewire component to display comments
- markdown submission is supported, we'll render it as html
- code snippets that appear in comments will automatically be highlighted
- users can react to comments (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, or any emoji you want)
- optionally, you enable a comment approval flow
- sane API for creating your own commenting UI
- Livewire components out of the box
At the core of this package is the HasComments trait you'll add to models:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Spatie\Comments\Models\Concerns\HasComments;
 
class Post extends Model
{
    use HasComments;
}
``` 

Which then enables you to manage comments and reactions on a model:

```php
$post->comment("I've got a feeling");
 
$comment->react('üòç');
``` 

While the above is a barebones example, the package also comes with a fully baked Laravel Livewire component, which also supports one level of nested comments:
