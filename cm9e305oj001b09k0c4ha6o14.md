## Overview

A common scenario is where a Google Cloud Data Sharing Partner has proprietary datasets that customers can use for their analytics use cases. Customers need to subscribe to this data, query it within their own platform, then augment it with their own datasets and use their visualization tools for their customer facing dashboards. This enables Data Sharing Partners to simplify and accelerate how they build and deliver value from data-driven solutions.

![overview diagram](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/I0dXN%2FnFXGEMlrAQwEOky4LHqxfkTR50FvHFHv2FmVc%3D align="left")

Through integration with Google Cloud IAM, you can set permissions on BigQuery objects to enable access by users inside or outside of organizations. In this lab, you will learn how Data Sharing Partners create Data Twins for customers either on Google Cloud or a different cloud service provider. For the purposes of this lab, the customer is on Google Cloud in a different project.

In this lab, you will wear two hats and be provided with three Google Cloud projects. In the first project, you are taking on the role of a Data Sharing Partner sharing a dataset generated by the partner's hosted solution using a Data Publishing project. In the second project, you will assume the role of a Data Sharing Partner who will share the source dataset in partner project as an authorized view in the Data Publishing project. In the third project, you will assume the role of a customer who will access the authorized view into their project as a Data Twin and join the data with their solution dataset to create enriched datasets.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create an authorized view for a Data Sharing Partner Dataset in different projects
    
* Secure access to the authorized view for a specific customer
    
* Use a customer generated dataset to join with the Data Sharing Partner dataset to create new insights
    

## Setup and Requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Username"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Password"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.
