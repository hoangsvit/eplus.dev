## **Overview**

[Google Meet](https://apps.google.com/meet/) is a video conferencing application that lets you hold impromptu video meetings on the go, virtual training classes around the world, remote interviews, and much more.

### What you'll do

In this lab, you do the following:

* Start a video meeting
    
* Join and collaborate in a video meeting
    
* Manage device settings
    

**Note:** You can also use Google Meet from your mobile device using the [Meet mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=en_US:\) on Android® and Apple® iOS® devices.

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Start your lab

1. When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left panel.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use to sign into Gmail for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
2. Click **Open Google Drive**.
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Username"
    ```
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Password"
    ```
    
    Click **Next**.
    
6. Accept all terms and conditions as prompted.
    

Google Drive opens and you are signed in to the Student Google Account.

## **Task 1. Start a video meeting**

1. Click the Google Apps dots, then click **Meet**.
