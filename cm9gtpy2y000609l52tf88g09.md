## Overview

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

## Challenge scenario

You are starting your career as a junior cloud architect. In this role, you have been assigned to work on a team project that requires you to use the Cloud Speech API services in Google Cloud.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge to complete the tasks that follow.

### Your challenge

For this challenge, you are required to transcribe speech to text in different languages using the Cloud Speech API.

You need to:

* Create an API key.
    
* Create and call your API request.
    
* Update the API request for transcription in different languages.
    

For this challenge lab, a virtual machine (VM) instance named `lab-vm` has been configured for you to complete the tasks.

Each task is described in detail below, good luck!

## Task 1. Create an API key

1. For this task, you need to create an API key to use in this and other tasks when sending a request to the Speech-to-Text API.
    

**Click here for hint!**

2. Save the API key to use in other tasks.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

## Task 2. Transcribe speech to English text

**Note:** This lab uses a pre-recorded file that's available on Cloud Storage: `gs://spls/arc131/question_en.wav`. You can [listen to this file](https://storage.cloud.google.com/spls/arc131/question_en.wav).

**Click here for hint!**

1. For this task, connect to the instance `lab-vm` provisioned for you via **SSH**.
    
2. Create a file named `request.json` as your API request to transcribe the audio file available at the `gs://spls/arc131/question_en.wav` location to English.
    
3. Call `request.json` and store the result in a file named `speech_response_en.json`.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

## Task 3. Transcribe speech to Spanish text

**Note:** This lab uses a pre-recorded file that's available on Cloud Storage: `gs://spls/arc131/multi_es.flac`. You can [listen to this file](https://storage.cloud.google.com/spls/arc131/multi_es.flac).

1. For this task, connect to the instance `lab-vm` provisioned for you via **SSH**.
    
2. Create a file named `speech_request_sp.json` as your API request to transcribe the audio file available at the `gs://spls/arc131/multi_es.flac` location to Spanish.
    
3. Call `speech_request_sp.json` and store the result in the file named `speech_response_sp.json`.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.
