### [Browser support](https://github.com/Simonwep/selection#browser-support)

This library will always have the previous year as its target. For 2021 for example the target will be ES2020. It always provides both a `UMD` (`.js`) and `.mjs` version. If you want to support legacy browsers, please use the feature of your bundler to transpile dependencies. In the case of Webpack and Babel (give [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a try, it's awesome) you'll have to install corresponding plugins such as [babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining) and include the dependency from `node_modules` which is normally entirely excluded from being processed.

I do this to provide maximum flexibility and give those who target ESNext a chance to make full use of how this library is bundled. Everything else is just a matter of configuration :)

### [Is this library the right choice for me?](https://github.com/Simonwep/selection#is-this-library-the-right-choice-for-me)

Viselect primarily focuses on being a high-performant engine to select elements with various boundaries, behaviors, and modes in your browser. Viselect is to "full-blown libraries" what is [popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) to [tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) - the *core* of your feature / of another library.

### [Development](https://github.com/Simonwep/selection#development)

Use the following commands to work on this locally (we use [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage this):

* `npm run dev` *\- Spawns a dev server for all packages. Every framework-dependent package is bundled with the vanilla version.*
    
* `npm run build` *\- Builds all packages in parallel.*
    
* `npm run lint:fix` *\- Lints and fixes all errors in all packages.*
    

For the development servers, [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used. It's superb, you should give it a try. To bundle it we use [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) (which is btw also used by Vite behind the scenes) to have full control over how the bundle looks.

### [Releasing a new version](https://github.com/Simonwep/selection#releasing-a-new-version)

This project is managed via [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). To bump the version and publish a new one run the following commands:

* `lerna version`
    
* `lerna publish from-package`
