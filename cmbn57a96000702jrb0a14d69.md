## Overview

[Data Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog) is a fully managed, scalable metadata management service within [Dataplex](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/introduction).

Managing data assets can be time consuming and expensive without the right tools. Data Catalog provides a centralized place where organizations can find, curate and describe their data assets.

### Using Data Catalog

There are two main ways you interact with Data Catalog:

* Searching for data assets that you have access to
    
* Tagging assets with metadata
    

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Explore a simulated enterprise environment of 2 projects, 2 datasets, and 2 user accounts.
    
* Navigate through a BigQuery table manually in the UI.
    
* Run queries to better understand sensitive data columns to then tag later.
    
* Use Data Catalog to **search** for existing datasets across projects.
    
* Use Data Catalog tag templates to **tag** assets with rich metadata.
    

### Why is this useful?

* View data assets across multiple projects in your organization.
    
* Create re-usable tag templates to add rich data descriptions for your teams.
    
* Quickly highlight which datasets have PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
    
* Metadata Access control is inherited based on logged in users (no separate Data Catalog ACLs needed).
    

### Prerequisites

**Very Important:** Before starting this lab, log out of your personal or corporate gmail account, or run this lab in Incognito. This prevents sign-in confusion while the lab is running.

## Setup and requirements

1. If you have not done so already, click **Start Lab**.
    
2. Tip: It will take 3 - 5 minutes for the lab environment to auto-generate 2 Google Cloud Projects, 2 pre-populated Datasets, and 2 user accounts. You do not need to wait for the lab resources to complete to continue reading this lab (you won't be logging in under after you read the scenario below)
    
3. Click **Open Bike Console** in the lab or in a new Incognito Browser window, navigate to the [Cloud Console](http://console.cloud.google.com/). Do not log in with any of the accounts provided yet. Continue reading the scenario first and you will be instructed later which account to use.
    

**Important Note**: Once started your lab cannot be paused and ending your lab will delete all student projects that are still running.

## Scenario: CEO of NYC transportation company

You are the head of a transportation business operating in New York City. You have teams of data analysts that query datasets you have collected about NYC travel (by bike and car).

**Challenges:**

* Some of your datasets contain sensitive information that you want to access control.
    
* Your team complains that finding the right dataset is difficult among the many other datasets they have access to.
    
* To comply with recent regulatory requirements, you need a very clear way to flag which datasets have PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in them.
    

### Datasets for your organization

* NYC Bike Share Trips
    
* NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions
    

Each data engineering team maintains their dataset **in their own separate Google Cloud Project** so they can better manage access and billing. While this is good for them, it makes these datasets less discoverable for your team of analysts.

### Not all analyst roles are equal

To make matters more complex, you have **different levels of data analysts** on your BI team working for you:

* Data Analysts - least privileges
    
* Owner - full admin
    

### Review what is being automatically created for you

In order to best simulate a true enterprise environment with multiple projects and datasets to catalog, your engineering team has given you access to already existing resources (the lab preloads resources so you don't have to create them).

![Several project and user links.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/irpyGs7y6lah2BfuC%2BoKXXuoKKVqBOVE3HbbL20Olno%3D align="left")

Your team has provided you logins as shown above to:

* 2 Projects
    
* 2 User Accounts
    

They added the following notes on access restriction:

* Owner should have full access to all projects and datasets.
    
* Data Analysts should not have access to see or query the NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset (sensitive data).
    

## Part 1: Explore the existing data environment with the owner role

Recall that your data engineering team provided you with three projects each containing a different New York City dataset. Confirm the **Owner role** can see and query all datasets.

1. Log in using the **Owner (full admin)** auto-generated email and password provided as part of this lab.
    
2. Accept the **Terms and Conditions** to use Google Cloud (if prompted).
    

### Find the NYC Collisions project

1. Click your project name dropdown at the top of the page to **Select a Project**.
    

![The highlighted project-dropdown](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/Fni6RLmKR%2BNNqvb8gLp46s0n0JRpyE4em%2BoQw0881Rs%3D align="left")

2. Refer to the Qwiklabs auto-generated project name for `NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Project` and find that string value in the Select a Project popup:
    

![The highlighter NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Project link.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/TniSuiw64aoj6VTaxP0gxZdMpWGqpjvrpYCoPgrNoL8%3D align="left")

![The highlighted string value in the No organization list.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/oW%2BtsGBbM9qVRYV3TbVLwEESeV29oVOgyV%2BFc90gktQ%3D align="left")

### Enable the Data Catalog API

1. Use the **Navigation menu &gt; Solutions &gt; All products** to scroll down until you see **Data Catalog**.
    
2. Hover over the name, then click the **pin icon**. This moves Data Catalog to the top of the Navigation menu.
    
3. Click **Data Catalog**. If a pop-up appears, click **Close**.
    
4. Confirm the API is enabled already (if there is no prompt to enable the API, then it is already enabled and no action is needed.)
    

You return later in this lab to use Data Catalog after you manually search and query the datasets first in BigQuery.

### Navigate to and pin BigQuery

1. Use the **Navigation menu** scroll down until you see **BigQuery**.
    
2. Hover over the name and click the **pin icon**.
    
3. Click **BigQuery** then click **Done**.
    

## Task 1. Confirm the owner role can view and query the new\_york\_mv\_collisions Dataset

Confirm that the owner role can view the `new_york_mv_collisions` dataset.

1. In BigQuery, under **Explorer** click your project name to toggle open the available datasets you have access to see.
    
2. Confirm you can see the `new_york_mv_collisions` dataset.
    
3. Click the `new_york_mv_collisions` dataset to toggle open the tables inside.
    
4. Click the `nypd_mv_collisions` table and explore the available fields in the schema.
    

The schema should look similar to the below:

![Schema tabbed page displaying fields in the nypd_mv_collisions table schema](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GNkEYopLK1qBIQijON2kb%2FLPFszk7L39BN6KOxq1gCg%3D align="left")

Answer the following questions.

**Submit**

Using the Details tab, how many records are in this table?Less than 500,0001.6+ Million1 Million

**Submit**

Using the Schema tab, which fields could be sensitive and need to be handled with care?number\_of\_persons\_killedon\_street\_namelocationAll of the Above

**Submit**

While there isn't personally identifiable information like a phone number or email address in this table, you still need to use caution when sharing this dataset across the wider team.

What could be a solution for addressing privacy and sensitivity concerns?Control access at the project and role levelFind a way to tag the dataset / columns as sensitiveControl access at the column levelAll of the Above

**Submit**

The remainder of this lab will focus on teaching you ways to access restricted datasets and use [Data Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog) to proactively tag datasets and tables with rich metadata for your organization.

**Note:** This NYPD Collisions dataset is auto-loaded into your project from the original [BigQuery Public Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nypd-mv-collisions) which is updated daily. Click the link to learn more about how the dataset was collected and to see example queries.

### Confirm that the owner role can query the collisions dataset

Since you're logged in as a global owner, confirm you can see and access both projects and datasets. Confirm you can run the below query.

* Copy and paste the below query into the **BigQuery Query Editor** and click **Run**:
    

**What were the 10 most common factors in NYC car crashes?**

```apache
SELECT
  contributing_factor_vehicle_1 AS collision_factor,
  COUNT(*) AS num_collisions
FROM
  `new_york_mv_collisions.nypd_mv_collisions`
WHERE
  contributing_factor_vehicle_1 != "Unspecified"
  AND contributing_factor_vehicle_1 != ""
GROUP BY
  collision_factor
ORDER BY
  num_collisions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

What was the most common factor?Failure to Yield Right-of-WayFatigued/DrowsyDriver Inattention/Distraction

**Submit**

4. Click the project ID.
    

**Note**: If prompted, Click LEAVE for Unsaved work.

5. In the BigQuery UI, toggle open the Project ID &gt; `new_york_citibike` &gt; `citibike_trips` table.
    

When viewing the schema, details, and preview answer the below questions.

How many records are in the table citibike\_trips table? Choose the best answerOver 210 Million TripsOver 58 Million TripsLess than 1 Million Trips

**Submit**

### What are the most popular Bike Share routes by gender?

The [NYC Citi Bike Public Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike) tracks each individual bike share trip (starting location, ending location) as well as other fields for each user.

* Add the below query to the **Query editor** and **Run** it to see the most popular routes by gender. Note that the only three values provided in the dataset are unknown, male, and female which may not be representative of all the gender values for bike share riders:
    

```apache
WITH unknown AS (
  SELECT
    gender,
    CONCAT(start_station_name, " to ", end_station_name) AS route,
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips
  FROM
    `new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
  WHERE gender = 'unknown'
  GROUP BY
    gender,
    start_station_name,
    end_station_name
  ORDER BY
    num_trips DESC
  LIMIT 5
)

, female AS (
  SELECT
    gender,
    CONCAT(start_station_name, " to ", end_station_name) AS route,
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips
  FROM
    `new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
  WHERE gender = 'female'
  GROUP BY
    gender,
    start_station_name,
    end_station_name
  ORDER BY
    num_trips DESC
  LIMIT 5
)

, male AS (
  SELECT
    gender,
    CONCAT(start_station_name, " to ", end_station_name) AS route,
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
  WHERE gender = 'male'
  GROUP BY
    gender,
    start_station_name,
    end_station_name
  ORDER BY
    num_trips DESC
  LIMIT 5
)

SELECT * FROM unknown
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM female
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM male;
```

TRUE or FALSE: The most popular route for males is the same as the most popular route for femalesTrueFalse

**Submit**

Looking at the citibike\_trips table schema, which fields will you want to tag as sensitive?birth\_yeargendercustomer\_planAll of the Above

**Submit**

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

Query the most popular bike route by gender

**Check my progress**

You explore how to tag datasets and tables with sensitive data next.

### Exploration recap

* You have explored each NYC dataset (Collisions and Bike Share trips)
    
* Each dataset is stored in a separate project
    
* The Owner role (who you are logged in as now) has access to view and query each dataset
    

## Part 2: Explore the existing data environment with restricted user access

So far in the lab you have been logged in as the **Owner** account which your data engineering team has provided with the highest level permissions.

You have asked your engineering teams to limit access to your **Data Analyst** users as follows

Data Analysts should see:

* NYC Bike Share
    

Data Analysts should **NOT** see:

* NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions
    

### Sign out of the Owner account

1. Click the profile icon.
    
2. Sign out.
    

## Task 3. Log in with the Data Analyst user and confirm restricted project access

1. Click **Use another account**.
    
2. Log back into Google Cloud using the `Data Analyst User` email and shared password.
    
3. Under **select a project** confirm you are only able to see one and not two Qwiklabs auto-generated projects.
    
4. Select the Qwiklabs project you can access.
    
5. Navigate to **BigQuery**.
    

## Task 4. Attempt to directly query a private dataset

In BigQuery, even if a project is not pinned or visible in your Explorer section you can still query it if you have access. Try to query the NYC Collisions dataset directly as a Data Analyst user by using the project-id.

* Add the below query from before and replace the project id prefix the project id for the `NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Project`:
    

```apache
SELECT
  contributing_factor_vehicle_1 AS collision_factor,
  COUNT(*) AS num_collisions
FROM
  `qwiklabs-gcp-REPLACE-HERE.new_york_mv_collisions.nypd_mv_collisions`
WHERE
  contributing_factor_vehicle_1 != "Unspecified"
  AND contributing_factor_vehicle_1 != ""
GROUP BY
  collision_factor
ORDER BY
  num_collisions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Receiving an access denied error message verifies your Data Analyst access level.

You have now explored the different privileges and accesses granted to owner roles (broadest set of privileges) and Data Analysts (most restrictive) when it comes to accessing projects, datasets, and queries.

Next you try and find a hidden dataset using the Data Catalog search functionality. Do you think it will show up for Data Analysts if BigQuery blocks you?

## Part 3: Using Data Catalog to tag datasets across projects

Now that you are familiar with the datasets and access levels granted to different roles, you address the challenges posed earlier in the sample scenario:

Challenges:

* Some of your datasets contain sensitive information that you want to access control.
    
* Your team complains that finding the right dataset is difficult among the many other datasets they have access to.
    

To comply with recent regulatory requirements, you need a very clear way to flag which datasets have PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in them. You address these challenges and complete this task with the Data Catalog service.

1. Open the navigation menu and click on **Data Catalog**.
    

**Note**: If prompted, Click LEAVE for Unsaved work.

**Note**: If you are presented with a screen asking you to enable the API, you need to re-login with the Owner role and enable it (this was a step earlier in this lab.)

2. On the Data Catalog homepage under **Systems**, filter for **BigQuery**.
    

**Note:** You may also see rows for the `qwiklabs-resources` project which you can ignore. That project provides shared assets across all labs.

3. Enter `qwiklabs-gcp` into **Data Catalog's** search bar to filter out external Qwiklabs resources.
    
4. Confirm your view as a Data Analyst looks similar to below:
    

![Data Catalog homepage](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/y4YrIUOuqNz1LlVyTTAJ3hecfPKDpmISo5guVN3qP9c%3D align="left")

True or false: Data Catalog can only surface BigQuery metadata and tags and not other data systems like Pub/SubTrueFalse

Regardless of the project you are logged into, Data Catalog will surface ALL of the BigQuery datasets that your role has access to.

Refer to the Type column. Which Datasets can you see in the Data Catalog search as a Data Analyst user?taxinonenew\_york\_citibikenew\_york\_mv\_collisions

**Submit**

As a Data Analyst user, you do not see `new_york_mv_collisions` in Data Catalog even though it does exist (you query it as an Owner).

Why is that? Next, explore how access control works at the Data Catalog level.

### How Data Catalog surfaces metadata

Before searching, discovering, or displaying Google Cloud resources, [Data Catalog checks that the user has been granted an IAM role](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/iam#searching_resources) with the metadata read permissions required by BigQuery, Pub/Sub, or other source system to access the resource.

Example: Data Catalog checks that the user has been granted a role with `bigquery.tables.get` permission before displaying BigQuery table metadata.

True or false: Google Cloud project owners have to maintain a separate access control list for BigQuery metadata in Data Catalog and cannot pass through existing BigQuery permissions for a given user.TrueFalse

## Task 5. Create a Data Catalog tag template from a BigQuery dataset

1. Click on the `new_york_citibike` dataset entry. This is a subset of the ride share dataset you are allowed to view.
    

![Dataplex page with BigQuery dataset details displayed in the Details tabbed page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2F1CJB%2BCupETggDm4E7KU5CJQOsOeyJ0VIwBRqbiYF%2Fw%3D align="left")

For BigQuery tables, Data Catalog allows you to tag:

* The Dataset itself
    
* The table
    
* Individual columns
    

2. Attempt to click on the **Attach tag** button.
    
3. Confirm you get a similar error:
    

![Error message: You don't have permission to attach tags to this entry Required permssion(s): bigquery.datasets.updateTag](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/43WkvWej0%2BoiH%2BMs5f34tqKttbGbyRY%2Bo1m82zapHGE%3D align="left")

4. In that dialog, hover over **Learn more** to see why it is not available.
    

It appears the Data Analyst role can search for metadata in Data Catalog but not attach new tags.

Next you'll see how Data Catalog **tagging permissions** and **tag templates** work.

### Data Catalog templates, tags, and permissions

Data Catalog tag templates help you create and manage common metadata about data assets in a single location. The tags are attached to the data asset, which means it can be discovered in the Data Catalog system. Using this feature, you can also build additional applications that consume this contextual metadata about a data asset.

### What does a tag template look like?

![Example Data Catalog tag template](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/TNZFT5s%2Fe9a5UMpi%2FK8v7M4PxwK2aQY7QUJcazz2ncg%3D align="left")

### Who can create a tag template?

In order to create tag templates, the user needs to have, at minimum, edit access to the resource in question (BigQuery for this lab) AND `datacatalog.tagTemplateUser` (assuming a template has already been created). To learn more, refer to the [Data Catalog IAM Guide](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/iam#attaching_tags_to_resources).

What if you need to create a new tag template? Then you would need to be at minimum a `datacatalog.tagTemplateCreator` or `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateOwner`. Owner allows you to delete existing templates and additional admin privileges.

Most common Data Catalog predefined Cloud IAM roles:

* `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateViewer`
    
* `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateUser`
    
* `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateCreator`
    
* `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateOwner`
    
* For a complete list of roles, refer to [Data Catalog roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#datacatalog)
    

## Task 6. Create a new Data Catalog template

1. Log in as the Owner role which has the `roles/datacatalog.tagTemplateOwner` permission.
    
2. Select the `NYC Bike Share Project` that you were using before.
    

**Note:** If you see a permission error, re-log with correct credentials. You probably picked the wrong Owner.

3. In the Google Cloud Console, in the **Navigation menu** (), click **View all products**. Under **Analytics**, click **Dataplex Universal Catalog**.
    
4. On the left menu, under **Manage Metadata**, click **Catalog**.
    
5. Click **Create tag template (Deprecated)**.
    
6. When prompted **Are you sure you want to continue?**, click **Proceed**.
    

**Note:** Tag templates are being replaced by aspect types but are still functional at this time. You can proceed with the next steps to create a tag template.

7. Enter the required information to define the tag template:
    

| **Property** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| **Template Display Name** | **New York Datasets** |
| **Template ID** | Leave the default value. |
| **Location** | `us-central1` |
| **Visibility** | **Public** |

8. Click **Add Field**
    
9. Name the new field **Contains PII**, check **Make this field required**, and select the **Boolean** type. Then, click **Done** when you're finished.
    
10. Click **Add field**.
    
11. Name the field **PII Type**, select the **Enumerated** type, and add the following values. Then, click **Done** when you're finished:
    

* **Value 1:** None
    
* **Value 2:** Birth date
    
* **Value 3:** Gender
    
* **Value 4:** Geo location
    

12. Click **Add field**.
    
13. Name the field **Data Owner Team**, check **Make this field required**, select the **Enumerated** type, and add the following values. Then, click **Done** when you're finished:
    

* **Value 1:** Marketing
    
* **Value 2:** Data Science
    
* **Value 3:** Sales
    
* **Value 4:** Engineering
    

14. Click **Create**.
    

### Applying tags at the dataset level

1. Click on **Search for entries not using this template**.
    
2. Click on the **new\_york\_mv\_collisions** dataset.
    

Notice that there are no **tags** below the dataset name.

3. Click **Attach Tags**.
    
4. Choose the template that you created earlier then click **OK**.
    
5. Use the dropdown menu to populate values for template fields with the following, then click **Save**:
    

* **Contains PII:** True
    
* **PII Type:** Geo location
    
* **Data Owner Team:** Engineering
    

6. View the tags at the dataset level.
    

### Applying tags at the table and column level

For more granular asset tagging, you can apply tags at the table and column level.

1. Navigate back to the assets from our earlier search and click on the table `nypd_mv_collisions`.
    
2. Click **Attach Tags** and set the following fields for:
    

* **Table:** nypd\_mv\_collisions
    
* **Column:** location
    
* **Tag Template:** New York Datasets
    
* **Tag values:**
    
    * **Contains PII:** True
        
    * **PII Type:** Geo location
        
    * **Data Owner Team:** Engineering
        

3. Click **Save**.
    

Note that the table now has three tag values: one each for **Contains PII**, **PII Type**, and **Data Owner Team**.

### Searching datasets by tag and tag key

Now that you have tagged, you can search your catalog by the tags you just added.

* In the search bar, copy and paste `tag:YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE.new_york_datasets.contains_pii`, and replace `YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE` with your current Project ID.
