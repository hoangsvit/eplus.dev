## Overview

Initially in your Google Admin console, all users and devices are placed in a single organizational unit (OU), called the top-level OU. All settings you make in the Admin console apply to this top-level OU and, therefore, to all users and devices in your account. Any child OUs created under the top-level OU inherit those settings.

In this lab, you learn how to create an organizational unit structure and configure applications based on organizational units (OUs).

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you use Google Workspace to do:

* Create three OUs and add users to those OUs.
    
* Configure application access based on OUs.
    
* Configure application settings based on OUs.
    

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with basic Google Workspace terminology
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Start your lab

When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left.

### Sign in to the Google Workspace Admin Console

To access the Google Workspace Admin Console, you must find your credentials and then sign in.

#### Find your lab's User Email and Password

To access the resources and console for this lab, locate the **User Email** and **Password** in the Lab Details panel. This panel is on the left or at the top, depending on the width of the browser window. Use these credentials to log in to the Google Workspace Admin Console.

If your lab requires other resource identifiers or connection-related information, they appear on this panel as well.

#### Sign in to the Admin Console

1. Click **Open Google Workspace Admin Console**.
    

***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

**Note:** If you see the **Verify your account** dialog:

* Click **Next**.
    
* Click the prefilled user.
    
* Click **Use another account**.
    

2. On the Sign in page, log in using the **User Email** and **Password** details provided.
    
3. When prompted, click **I understand** and **ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICE** to accept all terms and conditions.
    

After a few seconds, the *Admin Console* opens.

4. Right-click **VERIFY DOMAIN** in either the yellow box at the top or the red box in the *Domains* card, and select **Open link in new tab**.
    
    **Note:** To complete this step in a real-life scenario, you'd need to add an actual DNS record.
    
5. Click the new tab, called **Domain setup**, to complete the Google Workspace domain verification steps.
    
6. On the *Let's set up your domain* page, click **Get Started**.
    
7. Select the **My domain uses a different host** checkbox and then click **Continue**.
    
8. At the bottom of the *Add verification code* page, select the **Come back here and confirm once you have updated the code on your domain host** checkbox, and then click **Confirm**.
    
9. Wait until it says **Your domain is verified!** and then close the *Domain setup* tab.
    
    **Note:** Do not click **Activate Gmail**.
    
10. Return to the **Admin Console** tab and refresh the page.
    

## Task 1. Create an organizational unit (OU) structure

To apply different settings to some users or devices, place them in a child OU, then customize the inherited settings of the child OU, and therefore the members of the child OU.

In this section, you create three OUs, and then apply different organizational policies to them.

### Create child OUs for Marketing, Compliance, and Contractors

Start by creating OUs.

1. Click the **Navigation menu** (
    
    ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ) &gt; **Directory** &gt; **Organization units**.
    
2. Click **Create organizational unit** to create a new OU.
    
3. For **Name of organizational unit**, enter **Marketing**
    
4. Optional: For **Description**, enter **The Marketing team**
    
5. Click **CREATE**.
    
6. Repeat steps 2-5 and create the **Compliance** and **Contractors** OUs.
    

### Create users in each of the OUs

Next, create three new users and place each of them into their own OU. Start by adding a user to the Marketing OU.

1. Click the **Navigation menu** (
    
    ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ) &gt; **Directory** &gt; **Users**.
    
2. Click **Add new user**.
    
3. For **First name**, enter **Jamie**.
    
4. For **Last name**, enter **Marketeer**.
    
5. For **Primary email address**, enter **jamie.marketeer**.
    
6. Click **Continue**, then click **Done**.
    
7. Select the checkbox next to Name **Jamie Marketeer**.
    
8. Click **More options** &gt; **Change organizational unit**. The Change organizational unit dialog opens.
    
9. Under **Google Workspace Labs**, select **Marketing**.
    
10. Click **Continue**, then click **Change**.
    
11. Click on the name **Jamie Marketeer**, then click **RESET PASSWORD**, and choose **Generate a new password**.
    

**Note:** Note the username and password. These will be used later in the lab.

12. Click **DONE**.
    
13. Repeat steps 2-12 to create two more users and assign them to an OU as described below:
    
    * User: **Leslie Compliance**, Email: **leslie.compliance**, OU: **Compliance**.
        
    * User: **Jesse Contractor**, Email: **jesse.contractor**, OU: **Contractors**.
        

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

Create OU structure and new users

**Check my progress**

## Task 2. Configure application settings based on OUs

In this section, you configure access settings for Gmail and Google Vault, and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) settings for Google Drive.

### Disable Gmail for Contractors

Customize Gmail access such that users in the Contractors OU do not have access to the Gmail service.

1. Click **Main menu** (
    
    ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ) &gt; **Apps** &gt; **Google Workspace** &gt; **Gmail**.
    

**Note:** If a prompt to verify your domain appears, under **Services**, click the checkbox next to **Gmail** to select it. Leave this tab open for the rest of the lab.  
  
Open a new Admin console tab and repeat steps 1 and 2. The **Service Status** for all apps should now indicate ‘ON for everyone’.

2. Click the **Service status** card.
    
3. In the left panel, under **Google Workspace Labs**, click **Contractors**.
    
4. For **Service status**, select **OFF** and click **OVERRIDE** to override the inherited settings and disable Gmail for all users in the Contractors OU.

* True
    
* False
    

**To add Users to an organizational unit:**

* You put users in each organizational unit that runs an app they use.
