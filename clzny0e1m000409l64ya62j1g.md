## **Overview**

As you start to give your virtual agent the ability to have more dynamic conversations, some of the more advanced features of Dialogflow CX can make your agent even more conversational. In this lab you'll learn how to use some advanced features of Dialogflow CX to enhance the conversational experience of your virtual agent. You'll learn how to add the ability for a user to check a flight's status through the virtual agent by providing a confirmation number and connect the 'Book a Flight' scenario into a new *Anything else?* page so that the agent is always ready to handle another request from the user.

**Objectives**

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Use regular expressions to do parameter validation (e.g., on a PNR Number).
    
* Reset parameters to null when the user starts a new flow of conversation.
    

**Prerequisites**

This lab builds upon the basic Flight Booker agent developed in **Dialogflow CX: Bot Building Basics** and therefore assumes knowledge of Dialogflow CX elements such as intents, entities, training phrases, flows, and pages. Building upon these basics, this lab will implement more advanced conversational techniques using some advanced features of Dialogflow CX. Though taking the earlier lab first is recommended, proceed if you are already familiar with Dialogflow CX and its fundamental features and usage.

---

## **Task 1. Getting started with Dialogflow CX**

In this task, you'll get logged into Dialogflow CX and create a new agent.

**Note**: Name your virtual agent **'Flight Booker - Parameter Manipulation'** when you get to that point in the steps.

Assumption: You've already logged into Google Cloud before continuing with the steps below.

1. In an new incognito window, navigate to [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/).
    
2. Click on **Sign-in with Google**.
    
3. Select the student account that you started the lab with.
    

Next, you explicitly specify that you want to use Dialogflow CX instead of Dialogflow ES.

1. In the menu bar at the left, click on **Dialogflow CX**.
    
    A new page for Dialogflow CX opens and a blue Dialogflow icon appears. On this page, you should see a pop-up asking you to select a project.
    
2. Search the list in the pop-up for the project that matches your assigned Project ID for this lab. Click on your project ID.
    

**Note:** If you don't see your Project ID listed, look at the user on the right side to confirm that you are using Dialogflow CX as "student".

![Dialogflow CX title bar highlighting the project box and the user avatar](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/R6vj%2B4XNhDXFFX2tKCJY%2B0C5c1LL4Lbw38BRGWzteSM%3D align="left")

You will now see a page telling you "To use Dialogflow CX with this project, enable the following APIs".

1. Click on **Enable API**.
    
    It shouldn't take more than half a minute or so for this activity to complete.
    
    If it seems this task is taking a long time, refresh the page.
    
    Once complete, you will be on the Dialogflow CX **Agents** page.
    
2. Click on **Create agent**.
    
3. If prompted with Get started with Dialogflow CX click **Build your own**.
    
4. Enter a name for the agent (e.g., "Cloudio-cx").
    
5. Set the location to `us-east1`.
    
6. Ensure timezone and default language are set appropriately.
    
7. Click **Create**.
    
    Once the agent is created, you will see the design and configuration portion of the Dialogflow CX UI.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## **Task 2. Importing a .blob virtual agent file**

In this task, you will import a virtual agent from an earlier lab.

1. Select *View all agents* from the **Agent** dropdown menu at the top.
    
2. Click the context menu (three vertical dots) to the right of your virtual agent.
    
3. Select **Restore** from the expanded menu options.
    
4. Select the **Cloud Storage** radio button if not already selected.
    
5. Enter `gs://spls/DialogflowCX_agents/gsp929-start-agent.blob` for URI.
    
6. Click **Restore**.
    
    Refer to the [Dialogflow CX "restore" documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#export) as needed.
    

Now you have a virtual agent that has everything completed from the earlier lab.

**Note:** If you'd like to retain a copy of the sample agent, download [gsp929-start-agent.blob](https://storage.googleapis.com/spls/DialogflowCX_agents/gsp929-start-agent.blob) to your local hard drive.

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

### Check your knowledge

Why do you have to enable the Dialogflow API?A service ticket will be created and a on-site engineer will manually provision a Dialogflow instance for youMost Google Cloud services in a new project needs to be explicitly enabled before you may gain access to it.The virtual agent needs to use webhook to invoke external APIs.

**Submit**

### Verify the restored agent

* Confirm the following pages and intents appear in your virtual agent:
    
    Pages:
    
    * Start
        
    * Ticket information
        
    * Confirm trip
        
    
    Intents:
    
    * Default Welcome Intent
        
    * Default Negative Intent
        
    * main.book\_a\_flight
        
    * confirmation.yes
        
    * confirmation.no
        

## **Task 3. Add functionality for checking flight status**

Now you'll add the ability for a user to speak to your agent to check flight status. You'll add a custom regex entity to capture the user's booking reference, also known as the *Passenger Name Record* (PNR) number. Regex (Regular Expression) is chosen because it's easy to specify a fixed format for the PNR - the advantage is built-in error checking.

### Create a custom Regex entity for booking reference (PNR Number)

Across the airline industry, a PNR is used to capture the basic information for a passenger and their flight details. Every PNR record has a unique reference identifier made up of alphanumeric (letters and numeric digits) characters and a length of five or six characters.

Naturally, when an end user provides a PNR number, you should validate that it conforms to the rules of a PNR number. Do this with a custom Regex entity.

1. Click on the **Manage** tab.
    
2. Click on **Entity Types** in the menu on the left.
    
3. Click **\+ Create**.
    
4. Enter `PNR_Number` in the *Display name* text box for the entity.
    
5. Check the *Regexp entities* box.
    
6. Enter `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,6}$` in the *Add value* text box under *Entity*.
    
    What does this regex expression actually mean? The bracketed characters, *\[a-zA-Z0-9\]*, mean that any letter regardless of case or digit will match. The *{5,6}* means the value must be five or six characters in length. The *$* asserts that we are at the end of the string.
    
    For instance, we may have a PNR of *XCr942* or *1f38C*.
    
    There are lots of regex resources online if you need to construct something a little different for your needs.
    
7. Click **Save**.
    

Your entity should look like the following when you click on it:

![The Entity type page displaying the highlighted entity value and selected Regexp entities checkbox](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/FgyfHC%2FpagC9dTTc53uBfdTueBadCy4atc69C%2F5yWVc%3D align="left")

### Create intents and pages for the flight status functionality

With the `@PNR_Number` custom entity created, we will now create the intents and pages that make up this flight status check conversational flow.

1. Click on **Intents** in the menu on the left.
    
2. Click **\+ Create**.
    
3. Enter `main.flight_status` in the Display name.
    
4. Add training phrases such as the following:
    
    | **Phrases** | **Annotations** |
    | --- | --- |
    | PNR K4P89E, what is the flight status? | K4P89E |
    | My PNR is Z453K9, is it still on time? | Z453K9 |
    | Is my flight on time? | n/a |
    | What is my flight status? | n/a |
    | I would like to know if my flight is still on time | n/a |
    | Check flight status | n/a |
    
    **Note:** The PNR\_Number entities should be automatically slot-filled by Dialogflow. If they aren't, you can manually annotate them by selecting and choosing the @PNR\_Number entity.
    
5. Ensure the PNR examples in the training phrases are annotated correctly to indicate @PNR\_Number and *NOT* @sys.number (system entity):
    
    * You do this by selecting the text and, using the filter, search for "PNR".
        
    * Then select the correct entity (@PNR\_Number). Make sure the whole thing is selected, not just a portion of it. This helps Dialogflow understand the format it should be looking for.
        
    
    It should look like the following when you're done:
    
    ![The Training phrases page with the highlighted PNR number](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lPLC0k5b0FTZYEA9Q1EZldUAaEZ49YwqeKg%2BZLgH3xc%3D align="left")
    
6. Notice *PNR\_Number* listed in the parameter section at the bottom of the intent configuration page. If this were sensitive data, we might have chosen the *Redact in log* option.
    
7. Click **Save**.
    

### Set up the Start page

Next, you'll update the **Start** page with a new route using the *main.flight\_status* intent and create the subsequent pages to complete this new conversational flow. Adding intents and their routes in the Start page ensures a user's request is recognized and can trigger Dialogflow to react correctly from anywhere in the flow.

1. Click on **Build** to view the overall flow.
    
2. Click on the **Start** page.
    
3. Click on **+** to the right of *Routes* in the upper right.
    
4. Select **main.flight\_status** from the *Intent* dropdown menu.
    
5. Scroll down to the *Transition* section.
    
6. Ensure that the **Page** radio button is enabled.
    
7. Select **+new Page** from the *Page* dropdown menu.
    
8. Enter `Check flight status` in the *Page name* box.
    
9. Click **Save**.
    
10. Close the routes configuration pane as needed to view the flow pane again.
    
11. Notice the *main.flight\_status* intent shows up in the list of routes for the *Start* page. In the flow pane, there's an arrow going from the *Start* to the *Check flight status* page.
    
12. Click on the *Check flight status* page.
    
13. Click on **+** to the right of *Parameters*.
    
14. Enter `pnr_num` for the *Display name*.
    
15. Select **@PNR\_Number** from the dropdown for the *Entity type*.
    
16. Click to enable *Required* if not already.
    
    Your parameter should look like the following:
    
    ![The Parameter page displaying the highlighted Display name, entity type, and required checkbox](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/Pl8GgzyTNxSnlUpkvxc1KFTRYyN4NiWsFNtEfhSfOtk%3D align="left")
    
17. Scroll down to the *Initial prompt fulfillment* section.
    
18. Enter `What is your flight booking reference please?` under *Agent says*.
    
19. Click **Save**.
    
20. Close the *Parameter* configuration pane as needed to view the flow pane again.
    
21. Click **+** to the right of **Routes** in the *Check flight status* page.
    
22. Scroll down to the *Condition* section.
    
23. Enter `$page.params.status` for the *Parameter*.
    
24. Ensure `=` is selected for the *Operand*.
    
25. Enter `FINAL` for the *Value*.
    
    Your condition should look similar to the following:
    
    ![The condition page displaying the highlighted parameter, operand, and value](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2F1aLAeBuhF86AnmGeYKTYpLdlLorIcgiidt3UyrCB0Q%3D align="left")
    
    **Note:** Did you notice some quotes around the word FINAL in the screenshot? The value of FINAL is acceptable with or without quotes, i.e., FINAL or "FINAL". This is because it's a single word without spaces. When you have more than one word it's best to use quotes. For instance, "Flight Status".
    
    The condition expression, "$page.params.status = FINAL", tells Dialogflow that, once your parameters have been successfully captured from the user, there's nothing further to do on this page.
    
26. Scroll down to the *Transition* section.
    
27. Select **\+ new Page** from the *Page* dropdown.
    
28. Enter `Confirm flight status` for the *Page name*.
    
29. Click **Save**.
    

### Set up the Confirm flight status page

1. Click on the **Confirm flight status** page.
    
2. Click on **Edit fulfillment**.
    
3. Enter a message under *Agent says* such as the following:
    
    ```plaintext
    Looking up your flight reference $session.params.pnr_num, we are pleased to confirm that your flight is on time and will depart LAX at 10am for NYC.  Please arrive at least 1.5 hours before departure.
    
    Would you like to make any changes to your flight?
    ```
    
    Copied!content\_copy
    
    **Note:** You will notice that all of the flight status queries in your testing will result in this same static message. How could you implement a dynamic lookup of flight status information? Through the webhook capability where Dialogflow CX will call an external API, provide the PNR reference, and retrieve the actual flight status.
    
    To use a webhook, you would enable the webhook checkbox. However, it is outside the scope of this lab as we are focused on the topic of conversational design. This is mentioned for completeness and to provide a pointer for your further learning.
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
5. Click **+** to the right of *Routes*. Recall that you may need to close out the right-hand pane configuration window to see this.
    
6. Select **confirmation.yes** from the *Intent* dropdown.
    
7. Scroll down to the *Fulfillment* section.
    
8. Enter `Our agents will be in touch soon for your request to amend your scheduled flight.` under *Agent says*.
    
9. Scroll down to the *Transition* section.
    
10. Select **+new Page** from the *Page* dropdown.
    
11. Enter `Anything else?` for the *Page name*.
    
12. Click **Save**.
    
13. Add another route, this time selecting **confirmation.no** from the *Intent* dropdown.
    
14. Add a message for this route; `Great, we look forward to having you fly with us soon.`.
    
15. Add a transition to the same **Anything else?** page that you created.
    
16. Click **Save**.
    

### Set up the Anything else? page

1. Click on the **Anything else?** page.
    
2. Click to open the **Entry fulfillment**.
    
3. Enter `Have you any further queries for me?` for the *Agent says*.
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
5. Click **+** to add a route from the *Anything else?* page.
    
6. Select **confirmation.yes** from the *Intent* dropdown.
    
7. Enter `Please let me know how I can be of service.` for the *Agent says* under *Fulfillment*.
    
8. Select **Start** for the *Page* under the *Transition* section.
    
9. Click **Save**.
    
10. Add another route, this time specifying the *confirmation.no* intent.
    
11. Enter `No worries, I'm glad to be of assistance today. Goodbye.` for the *Agent says* under *Fulfillment*.
    
12. Choose **End Session** page as the transition.
    
13. Click **Save**.
    

## **Task 4. Testing your virtual agent**

### Part 1 (positive tests)

1. Click on **Test Agent** to open the test simulator.
    
    Ideally you have defined some test data with expected results. One way you can organize your test data is in the order of progression of the conversation, much like you see in a chat bot conversation.
    
2. Proceed to performing a round of testing on your agent similar to the test data below.
    
    | **Who** | **Message** |
    | --- | --- |
    | User | Check flight status |
    | Agent | What is your flight booking reference please? |
    | User | 1234 |
    | Agent | What is your flight booking reference please? |
    | User | abcdefghijk |
    | Agent | What is your flight booking reference please? |
    | User | P34K09 |
    | Agent | Looking up your flight reference P34K09, ... |
    | User | no |
    | Agent | Great, we look forward to having you fly with us soon. Have you any further... |
    | User | no |
    | Agent | No worries, I'm glad to be of assistance today. Goodbye. |
    
3. Notice that the test data deliberately uses *1234* (too short) and *abcdefghijk* (too long) before using a valid PNR number, *P34K09*. Because of the regex expression you defined, the first two values entered by the user are considered invalid PNR numbers. Therefore, the agent keeps asking until it can fulfill the parameter status condition (FINAL) and transition to the next page.
    
    **Note:** If you make any mistakes in your testing, you can always reset the test using the trash icon in the upper right of the Test Agent.
    
4. Notice in the simulator pane that there is some data about the conversation. For instance, the flow of pages, intents matched, parameters and their filled values.
    
5. Click on the reset icon to clear the current test data. It's a good habit to do this after every complete test round unless you want to repeat the same test again (using the recycle icon).
    

### Part 2 (negative tests)

Now, instead of responding `No` when the flow gets to the *Anything else?* page, you'll respond `Yes`.

* Start another round of testing on your agent, this time a negative test. For instance:
    
    | **Who** | **Message** |
    | --- | --- |
    | User | Check flight status |
    | Agent | What is your flight booking reference please? |
    | User | PN34K5 |
    | Agent | Looking up your flight reference PN34K5, ... |
    | User | no |
    | Agent | Great, we look forward to having you fly with us soon. Have you any further... |
    | User | yes |
    | Agent | Please let me know how I can be of service |
    | User | check flight status |
    | Agent | Looking up your flight reference PN34K5, ... |
    
    **Note:** Did you notice that when you requested to check flight status the second time, you weren't prompted for the PNR? That's not the expected response for this scenario where the user wants to look up a different record.
    
    What happened? Well, Dialogflow remembered the number entered earlier. To make it work for this scenario, you'll need to reset, or nullify, the `pnr_num` parameter.
    
    Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.
    
    Testing your virtual agent
    
    **Check my progress**
    

## **Task 5. Resetting parameters**

1. Click on the **Anything else?** page.
    
2. Click on the Entry fulfillment field to open the Fulfillment configuration pane.
    
3. Scroll down to the *Parameter presets* section.
    
4. Click **Add a parameter**.
    
5. Enter `pnr_num` for the *Parameter* name under *Parameter presets*.
    
6. Enter `null` for the *Value*.
    
7. Click **Save**.
    
8. Run through your tests again to ensure all parameters are reset to null so that the agent will reprompt for new values when the conversation starts over.
    
    Your **Anything else?** page should look like the following:
    
    ![The Anything else? page displaying the highlighted entry fulfillment field and parameter presets section](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/sVVfgPQGHi88SSA0lLKiMvK7Bncn8KBt95bajCMASfo%3D align="left")
    

### Connect the Anything else? page to the Confirm trip page

The **Anything else?** page can be reused for the flight booking conversational flow that you imported at the start of this lab. The expected outcome is our virtual agent is able to continue the conversation if required by the user at the end of their queries.

1. Click on the **Confirm trip** page.
    
2. Click on the *confirmation.yes* route.
    
3. Add a transition to the **Anything else?** page.
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
5. Run through the *check flight status* tests again to ensure the `pnr_num` parameter is reset to null so that the agent will reprompt for a new value when the user wants to check a different flight.
    
    **Note:** Click on the reset icon in the **Test Agent** pane to make sure your next test scenario starts fresh.
    
6. Now run through the *flight booking* test scenario to completion and book the flight. Answer, `Yes`, when you reach the *Anything else?* portion of the flow and start a new flight booking.
    
    **Note:** What worked and what didn't? You may have noticed that the agent remembers the flight details from your previous booking and does not bother asking you again. Is this the correct behavior?
    
    Just like in the *check flight status* scenario, you will want to reset the flight booking parameters to null.
    
7. Click on the **Anything else?** page.
    
8. Click on **Entry fulfillment**.
    
9. Add parameters as follows, setting them to null like you did with the `pnr_num`:
    
    | **Parameter** | **Value** |
    | --- | --- |
    | departure\_city | null |
    | destination\_city | null |
    | departure\_date | null |
    | return\_date | null |
    | passenger\_name | null |
    
10. Click **Save**.
    
11. Run through the tests again to ensure all parameters are reset to null when you answer `No` to the question on whether the information is correct.
    

**Knowledge check**

A custom regex entity is useful for which of the following data types?A system date entity.A custom size entity with fixed values (e.g., small, medium, large).A custom alphanumeric entity that conforms to a pattern.

**Submit**

In what scenario is it required to reset parameters captured during the conversation?When additional values need to be captured and you no longer need the previously captured data for the conversation.Parameters should always be reset.Parameters never need to be reset because the AI in Dialogflow will figure it out.

**Submit**

### Export your agent

If you want to export your virtual agent to use in your own project, use the following steps:

1. Select **View all agents** from the *Agent* dropdown at the top.
    
2. Click on the context menu (three vertical dots ) and choose **Export**.
    
3. Click on the **Download** radio button.
    
4. Click **Export**.
