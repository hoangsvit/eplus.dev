## Overview

Google Workspace makes it easier to create documents that help you assign tasks, track progress and collaborate across several Workspace apps. Smart canvas from Workspace is a set of capabilities that makes it easier to create content in and collaborate on your documents. In this lab, you will learn to use smart canvas features like smart chips and building blocks to simplify the way you work.

### Scenario: Project Manager at an Advertising Agency

Congratulations on starting your new job as a project manager for a small advertising agency! In the following tasks, you will use smart canvas in Google Docs to draft emails, create meeting notes and help keep your team on track.

### What you’ll learn

* Insert smart chips into Docs files
    
* Use building blocks to draft emails and calendar invites
    
* Review documents using automatically generated summaries and version history
    
* Assign action items and tasks
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click Start Lab

Read these instructions. **Labs are timed and you cannot pause them.** The timer starts when you click **Start Lab** and shows how long Google Workspace resources are available to you.

This Google Workspace hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Workspace for the duration of the lab.

### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    
* Time. Note the time at the top of the left panel, which is an estimate of how long it should take to complete all steps. Plan your schedule so you have time to complete the lab. Once you start the lab, you will not be able to pause and return later (you begin at step 1 every time you start a lab).
    
* You do NOT need a Google Workspace account. An account is provided to you as part of this lab.
    

Open an Incognito window to run this lab.

When your lab prompts you to log into the console, **use only the student account provided to you by the lab**. This allows the activity tracking to verify that you have completed the lab activities.

### Start your lab

1. When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left panel.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use to sign into Gmail for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
2. Click **Open Google Drive**.
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-02-038bdda212bc@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    Ht3HJmnJF5jx
    ```
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
7. Accept all terms and conditions as prompted.
    

Google Drive opens and you are signed in to the Student Google Account.

## Task 1. Mention names and dates in your docs

Smart chips are a powerful tool that can be used to add interactivity and context to your documents and spreadsheets. Where there’s a smart chip in your document, you can hover or click a chip to get more information. They can be used to:

* @-mention people, dates, and assign tasks
    
* Search for and link documents
    
* Insert and preview locations using Google Maps In this task, you add people and date chips to a project charter document. You also learn how to create a document summary and manage a file’s version history.
    

### View more information about colleagues

1. After you have logged into Google Drive from your student account, double-click **Project Charter** to open the document that's been created for you.
    
    A project charter is a brief document created during the beginning stage of a project. It includes details like a project’s goals, timeline, and budget.
    
2. To add yourself to the document using a people chip, in the box for **Project Manager**, type **@me** and select your student email address from the results.
    
    Smart chips will automatically suggest matches to what you’re typing including people, dates, and tasks. Your email address should be the first result in the list.
    
3. Once you insert the smart chip, click it to display contact details.
    
    Clicking a people chip can populate shortcuts to help you quickly send the person an email, chat message, or video meeting invite. These chips can also allow you to quickly view more information about colleagues or contacts, including their location, job title, and contact information.
    

**Note:** Some shortcuts or contact details may not appear if you're clicking your own people chip or if the person is not in your same organization.

### Reference a date

1. To insert a date, in the box for **Start date**, type **@** to open the search menu.
    
    You can also access smart chip options from the **Insert** menu.

4. In the box for **End Date**, type **@date**, and then click **Date**.
    
5. Click the Next month (**\&gt;**) button 3-6 times, select a date in the future, and then click **OK**.
    
    You can also try these shortcuts to quickly populate dates:
    
    * **@yesterday**: Shows yesterday’s date
        
    * **@tomorrow**: Shows tomorrow’s date
        
    * A relative date, like **@Monday**, **@next Tuesday**, or **@last Wednesday**
        
    * A specific date, like **@8/29/23**
