    * Write as much code as you can to show off your skills.
        
3. **Given an array that represents sock colors:** `Sock_colors = [3,3,2,1,1,3,5,1,4,2]`**, how many pairs of the same color socks exist?**
    
    * 3
        
    * 2

4. **It is best to remain silent when writing code during a technical interview.**
    
    * True

    * <mark>The rate at which memory is transferred into cache.</mark>
        
    * The rate at which instructions are processed.
        
    * The rate at which a processor can convert input from a terminal.
