## Overview

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

In this lab, you will create a Flutter app using generated template code.

The basic Flutter interface provides a simple example to get started programming in Flutter.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you will learn about the following:

* How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android, and the web
    
* Basic structure of a Flutter app
    
* Finding and using packages to extend functionality
    
* Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle
    

## Prerequisites

Based on the content, it is recommended to have some familiarity with:

* Flutter
    
* Dart
    

## Setup

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-03-32c7f714dbf9@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    Copied!
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    uZjz9YWYZFoB
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-02-46a9176174df`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-02-46a9176174df
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-03-32c7f714dbf9@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-02-46a9176174df
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## Task 1. Open the Code Server editor

In this lab, we will use a custom editor that includes the Flutter and Dart extensions.

From the initial lab panel:

![The Lab Details pane displaying the populated IDE and Live Server text fields](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/dS9s9A4jV8gOitYPn9bza6lrsxf0JUsXrSUiKElg%2FSU%3D align="left")

1. Copy the Flutter IDE address displayed.
    
2. Paste the IDE address into a Browser tab.
    

## Task 2. Create a Flutter template

In this section create a Flutter Web application called **first\_app**.

1. Click the hamburger button (i.e. left hand side, three horizontal lines
    
    ![The Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ).
    
2. Open a Terminal within the browser by selecting New Terminal.
    

![The navigation path to 'New Terminal' highlighted](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/OT1O6e0jMpk2kH4l7As2GAPLdXD1GDK%2Fse908wrGNDo%3D align="left")

3. In the terminal enter the following command:
    

```apache
flutter create first_app
```

Copied!

4. Move to the **first\_app** directory:
    

```apache
cd first_app
```

5. Close the terminal window
    

```apache
exit
```

The `first_app` directory and template code have now been created.

## Task 3. Exploring the Flutter code

In this section edit the Flutter Web application.

Use the editor to open the `first_app` directory created in the previous step.

1. From the main panel select the `Explorer` Icon.
    

![The Explorer icon highlighted and the expanded Explore menu displayed](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/7cdmtgFGsLotPUOhX2Xf6yAxSQObtulqRbX%2B8Jj3%2Bns%3D align="left")

2. Select the `Open Folder` option
    
3. Open the `first_app` folder i.e.
    

```apache
/home/ide-dev/first_app
```

4. The editor view will change to the Folder view.
    

![The folder view with the `pubspec.yaml`option highlighted](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/IJnLEmSQjwBLfScai3fA9B92sPFQijlz%2Br4pbc13Wm0%3D align="left")

5. Explore the template code, especially the `lib/main.dart` and `pubspec.yaml` files.
    

## Task 4. Running the Flutter web application

In this section run the Flutter Web application from the command line.

1. In the editor, open a Terminal
    
2. Ensure the directory is set to `first_app`:
    

```apache
fwr
```

The running web server should look similar to below:

![The running web server details](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/KumcS%2BFTd5wF7eaee%2FARj%2F6Oc2hTg3E9UwYNERfTKvI%3D align="left")

3. Copy the Flutter Live Server address from the lab Panel
    
4. Paste the address into a new browser tab
    
5. The browser will render the web application e.g.
    

![The Flutter Demo Home Page title displayed on a mobile phone ](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vQHThflLRdWN4D30tlmdFKrHClP2kiAznEUwmCQpAKg%3D align="left")

**Note:**  
Rendering of the web application can take up to ten seconds. The view will show the application based on the code in the editor.

Feel free to interact with the running application.

## Task 5. Flutter Hot reload

Flutter supports `Hot reload` which means changes can be made to the application dynamically.

In this section we use the `Hot reload` function to change the Title.

1. In the editor, amend the file `lib/main.dart`
    
2. Look for `class MyApp` and find the Title field `Flutter Demo Home Page`
    

![The following line of code highlighted on the build page: home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/S%2B2D3pKDdY%2BqHMXeCKrrk9xp9MAgbPPAXC7I0MLTCAk%3D align="left")

3. Amend the HomePage `title` value on `line 27` to the following
    

```apache
Flutter is awesome
```

**Note:**  
Flutter templates may change with each revision, so your code may look slightly different. If the line is not the same, use the editor find command to look for the MyHomePage widget value.

4. Save the editor changes made i.e. `CTRL+S`
    
5. The `lib/main.dart` code should now look similar to below:
    

![The following line of code highlighted on the build page: home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter is awesome!'](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/UrMIS%2F3IwcHQFLkKs7iPz9bBiEP8NQz6gx5lFo0E3ig%3D align="left")

6. Click in the open Terminal window, and press ‘r'
    

![The terminal window displaying the message: To hot restart changes while running, press "r" or "R"](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ds1GqZ6M8J01o2SfxSzwqvwqbLjpQER4fkpnByUHHFY%3D align="left")

7. Switch to the `Flutter Device` browser tab
    
8. Press `CTRL+R` to reload the page
