## Overview

* Labs are timed and cannot be paused. The timer starts when you click **Start Lab**.
    
* The included cloud terminal is preconfigured with the gcloud SDK.
    
* Use the terminal to execute commands and then click **Check my progress** to verify your work.
    

## Challenge scenario

* Your organization's website has been experiencing increased traffic. To improve fault tolerance and scalability, you need to distribute the load across multiple Cloud Storage buckets hosting replicas of your website content.
    
* Currently, you have an existing Cloud Storage Bucket named `qwiklabs-gcp-02-69bb1089a558`\-bucket.
    
* To achieve the above goal you need to:
    
    * Create a new bucket in `europe-west4` with `qwiklabs-gcp-02-69bb1089a558`\-new as bucket name.
        
    * Synchronize the website content between these two buckets.
        
    * Create a Load balancer that will distribute the traffic to this backend bucket.
        
    * Enable health checks for the backend bucket to ensure traffic is only directed to healthy instances.
        
    
    **Note:** Please wait for few minutes to get the content of the website page delivered.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Distribute the traffic across multiple GCS buckets and view the website.
