## Overview

[Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs) is a document understanding solution that takes unstructured data (e.g. documents, emails, invoices, forms, etc.) and makes the data easier to understand, analyze, and consume. The API provides structure through content classification, entity extraction, advanced searching, and more.

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Document AI Form Parser to parse a handwritten form with Python. You will use a simple medical intake form as an example, but this procedure will work with any generalized form supported by DocAI.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

* Extract data from a scanned form using the Document AI Form Parser
    
* Extract key/value pairs from a form using the Document AI Form Parser
    
* Extract and export CSV data from a form using the Document AI Form Parser
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-00-c885839ed5fc@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    VR85IhJxTz41
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-02-fcdce3a4a021`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-02-fcdce3a4a021
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-00-c885839ed5fc@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-02-fcdce3a4a021
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## Task 1. Enable the Document AI API

Before you can begin using Document AI, you must enable the API.

1. Open Cloud Shell by clicking the **Activate Cloud Shell** button at the top of the console.
    
2. In Cloud Shell, run the following commands to enable the API for Document AI.
    

```apache
gcloud services enable documentai.googleapis.com
```

You should see something like this:

```apache
Operation "operations/..." finished successfully.
```

You will also need to install [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), an Open Source Data Analysis library for Python.

3. Run the following command to install Pandas.
    

```apache
pip3 install --upgrade pandas
```

4. Run the following command to install the Python client libraries for Document AI.
    

```apache
pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-documentai
```

You should see something like this:

```apache
...
Installing collected packages: google-cloud-documentai
Successfully installed google-cloud-documentai-2.15.0
```

Now, you're ready to use the Document AI API!

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Enable the Document AI API.

## Task 2. Create a Form Parser processor

You must first create a Form Parser processor instance to use in the Document AI Platform for this tutorial.

1. In the Cloud console, open the **Navigation menu** (
    
    ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ), click **View All Products** &gt; **Artificial Intelligence** &gt; **Document AI**.
    

![Document AI Overview Console](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/DrloY2MFgVSuxoip2X%2BiebqoLJi89TCKqVTaHfkt9zM%3D align="left")

2. Click **Explore Processors**, and inside **General** click **Form Parser** to open **Create Processor** page.
    

![Processors](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/p1q9Q%2ByBpA92cAHrGUq9o5y2GBIyVmS19hc0UNo67gI%3D align="left")

3. Give it the name `lab-form-parser` and select the closest region on the list.
    
4. Click **Create** to create your processor
    
5. **Copy** your Processor ID. You must use this in your code later.
    

![Processor ID](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/JysKEpZ2vte87yEYB3TM9AnjMe67KPWPibmXkPtZTsI%3D align="left")

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Create a processor

### Test the processor in the Cloud Console

You can test out your processor in the console by uploading a document.

1. Right click the image below, and select **Save Image As** to download the sample form.
    

![Health Form](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/BNzkMtevOCP7MHNiwOvYNaCtochz16p9CYkBl1tnFos%3D align="left")

2. On the **Processor Details** page, click **Upload Test Document**. Select the form you just downloaded.
    

Your Form Parser processor will process the document and return the parsed form data. It should look something like this:

![Parsed Form](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/z3kXq1frrTkotAMSwOnM4lfvpwxF0FZM2pM1oLX5ZEc%3D align="left")

## Task 3. Download the sample form

In this section, you will download a sample document which contains a simple medical intake form.

1. Run the following command to download the sample form to your Cloud Shell.
    

```apache
gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/codelabs/form-parser/intake-form.pdf .
```

2. Confirm the file is downloaded to your Cloud Shell using the below command:
    

```apache
ls intake-form.pdf
```

## Task 4. Extract form key/value pairs

In this section, you will use the online processing API to call the Form Parser processor you created previously. Then, you will extract the key value pairs found in the document.

Online processing is for sending a single document and waiting for the response. You can also use batch processing if you want to send multiple files or if the file size exceeds the [online processing maximum pages](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list#:~:text=PNG%2C%20BMP%2C%20WEBP-,Maximum%20pages%20\(synchronous/online%20requests\)%3A,-5).

The code for making a process request is identical for every processor type aside from the Processor ID. The [Document](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/documentai/latest/google.cloud.documentai_v1.types.Document) response object contains a list of pages from the input document. Each `page` object contains a list of form fields and their locations in the text.

The following code iterates through each page and extracts each key, value and confidence score. This is structured data that can more easily stored in databases or used in other applications.

1. In Cloud Shell, create a file called `form_parser.py` and paste the following code into it:
    

```javascript
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import documentai_v1 as documentai


def online_process(
    project_id: str,
    location: str,
    processor_id: str,
    file_path: str,
    mime_type: str,
) -> documentai.Document:
    """
    Processes a document using the Document AI Online Processing API.
    """

    opts = {"api_endpoint": f"{location}-documentai.googleapis.com"}

    # Instantiates a client
    documentai_client = documentai.DocumentProcessorServiceClient(client_options=opts)

    # The full resource name of the processor, e.g.:
    # projects/project-id/locations/location/processor/processor-id
    # You must create new processors in the Cloud Console first
    resource_name = documentai_client.processor_path(project_id, location, processor_id)

    # Read the file into memory
    with open(file_path, "rb") as image:
        image_content = image.read()

        # Load Binary Data into Document AI RawDocument Object
        raw_document = documentai.RawDocument(
            content=image_content, mime_type=mime_type
        )

        # Configure the process request
        request = documentai.ProcessRequest(
            name=resource_name, raw_document=raw_document
        )

        # Use the Document AI client to process the sample form
        result = documentai_client.process_document(request=request)

        return result.document


def trim_text(text: str):
    """
    Remove extra space characters from text (blank, newline, tab, etc.)
    """
    return text.strip().replace("\n", " ")


PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
LOCATION = "YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION"  # Format is 'us' or 'eu'
PROCESSOR_ID = "FORM_PARSER_ID"  # Create processor in Cloud Console

# The local file in your current working directory
FILE_PATH = "form.pdf"
# Refer to https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list
# for supported file types
MIME_TYPE = "application/pdf"

document = online_process(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    processor_id=PROCESSOR_ID,
    file_path=FILE_PATH,
    mime_type=MIME_TYPE,
)

names = []
name_confidence = []
values = []
value_confidence = []

for page in document.pages:
    for field in page.form_fields:
        # Get the extracted field names
        names.append(trim_text(field.field_name.text_anchor.content))
        # Confidence - How "sure" the Model is that the text is correct
        name_confidence.append(field.field_name.confidence)

        values.append(trim_text(field.field_value.text_anchor.content))
        value_confidence.append(field.field_value.confidence)

# Create a Pandas Dataframe to print the values in tabular format.
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Field Name": names,
        "Field Name Confidence": name_confidence,
        "Field Value": values,
        "Field Value Confidence": value_confidence,
    }
)

print(df)
```

2. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION`, `YOUR_PROCESSOR_ID`, and the `FILE_PATH` with appropriate values for your environment.
    

**Note** that the `FILE_PATH` is the name of the file you downloaded to Cloud Shell in the previous step. If you didn't rename the file, it should be `intake-form.pdf`, which you will need to update in the code.

3. Run the following command to execute the script:
    

```apache
python3 form_parser.py
```

You should see the following output:

```apache
                                           Field Name  Field Name Confidence                                        Field Value  Field Value Confidence

## Task 5. Parse tables

The Form Parser is also able to extract data from tables within documents. In this section, you will download a new sample document and extract data from the table. Since you are loading the data into Pandas, this data can be output to a CSV file and many other formats with a single method call.

### Download the Sample Form with Tables

We have a sample document which contains a sample form and a table.

1. Run the following command to download the sample form to your Cloud Shell.
    

```apache
gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/codelabs/form-parser/form_with_tables.pdf .
```

2. Confirm the file is downloaded to your Cloud Shell using the below command:
    

```apache
ls form_with_tables.pdf
```

### Extract Table Data

The processing request for table data is exactly the same as for extracting key-value pairs. The difference is which fields you extract the data from in the response. Table data is stored in the `pages[].tables[]` field.

This example extracts information about from the table header rows and body rows for each table and page, then prints out the table and saves the table as a CSV file.

1. Create a file called `table_parsing.py` and paste the following code into it:
    

```javascript

        df = pd.DataFrame(
            data=body_row_values,
            columns=pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(header_row_values),
        )

        print(f"Page {page.page_number} - Table {index}")
        print(df)

        # Save each table as a CSV file
        output_filename = f"{output_file_prefix}_pg{page.page_number}_tb{index}.csv"
        df.to_csv(output_filename, index=False)
```

2. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION`, `YOUR_PROCESSOR_ID`, and the `FILE_PATH` with appropriate values for your environment.
    

**Note** that the `FILE_PATH` is the name of the file you downloaded to Cloud Shell in the previous step. If you didn't rename the file, it should be `form_with_tables.pdf`, which is the default value and doesn't need to be changed.

3. Run the following command to execute the script:
    

```apache
python3 table_parsing.py
```

You should see the following output:

```apache
Page 1 - Table 0
     Item    Description
0  Item 1  Description 1
1  Item 2  Description 2
2  Item 3  Description 3
```

You should also have a new CSV file in the directory you are running the code from.

4. Run the following command to list the files in your current working directory:
    

```apache
ls
```

You should see the following output:

```apache
form_with_tables_pg1_tb0.csv
```
