## Overview

One of the best tools for reducing Gen AI hallucinations is to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is the concept of retrieving some data or information, then augmenting your prompt used with your Large Language Model (LLM), which allows it to generate more accurate responses based on the data included in the prompt.

You'll also leverage the capabilities of AlloyDB AI, Google Cloud's database for AI-powered applications, and LangChain, a framework for developing applications, to connect the LLM to external data sources. By the end of this lab, you'll have a functional chat application that can intelligently answer questions by retrieving relevant information from your database.

![Lab architecture diagram](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/IZiudasvm8AFgAFKsTO7cx3iLebhXigiv6lYK%2Bd6Ek0%3D align="left")

### What you'll learn

* How LLMs process language and how RAG enhances their capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
    
* Set up and interact with AlloyDB, a scalable and performant PostgreSQL database designed for demanding workloads.
    
* Explore LangChain's tools and components for building LLM-powered applications, including document loaders, prompt templates, and chains.
    
* Connect AlloyDB as a vector store with LangChain, allowing the chat application to access and retrieve relevant information for generating responses.
    
* Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat application, allowing users to ask questions and receive informative answers.
    

## Setup and Requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-00-c2eb34e2c0b7@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    57c5v2uPZYFQ
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

![Navigation menu icon and Search field](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9Fk8NYFp3quE9mF%2FilWF6%2FlXY9OUBi3UWtb2Ne4uXNU%3D align="left")

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-01-66510639eea9`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-01-66510639eea9
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-00-c2eb34e2c0b7@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-01-66510639eea9
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

### Configure Cloud Shell

Inside Cloud Shell, make sure that your project ID is setup:

Usually the project ID is shown in parentheses in the command prompt in the cloud shell as it is shown in the picture:

![Cloud Shell](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/PB2ZZfgldYC6oxNawLMme3Wr5LWLswtwHr8CJ7D6chM%3D align="left")

Configure your default region to `us-central1` to use the Vertex AI models. Read more about [regional restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/vertex-ai/work-with-embeddings#regional_restrictions).

```apache
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
```

## Task 1. Initialize the Environment

### Install Postgres client

Install the PostgreSQL client software on the deployed VM

1. Connect to the VM:
    

```apache
gcloud compute ssh instance-1 --zone=us-central1-c
```

Enter **Y** and then when asked for a passphrase press **ENTER** twice.

**Note:** First time the SSH connection to the VM can take longer since the process includes creation of RSA key for secure connection and propagating the public part of the key to the project

Expected console output:

```apache
student@cloudshell:~ (test-project-402417)$ gcloud compute ssh instance-1 --zone=us-central1-a

2. Install the software running command inside the VM:
    

```apache
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --yes postgresql-client 
```

Expected console output:

```apache

### Connect to the Instance

Connect to the primary instance from the VM using psql.

Continue with the opened SSH session to your VM. If you have been disconnected then connect again using the same command as above.

1. Use the previously noted $PGASSWORD and the cluster name to connect to AlloyDB from the Compute Engine VM:
    

```apache
export PGPASSWORD=alloydbworkshop2023
```

```apache
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export REGION=us-central1
export ADBCLUSTER=alloydb-aip-01
export INSTANCE_IP=$(gcloud alloydb instances describe $ADBCLUSTER-pr --cluster=$ADBCLUSTER --region=$REGION --format="value(ipAddress)")
psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres sslmode=require" 
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ export PGPASSWORD=P9...
student@instance-1:~$ export REGION=us-central1
student@instance-1:~$ export ADBCLUSTER=alloydb-aip-01
student@instance-1:~$ export INSTANCE_IP=export INSTANCE_IP=$(gcloud alloydb instances describe $ADBCLUSTER-pr --cluster=$ADBCLUSTER --region=$REGION --format="value(ipAddress)")
student@instance-1:~$ psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres sslmode=require"

postgres=> 
```

2. Exit from the psql session keeping the SSH connection up:
    

```apache
exit 
```

Expected console output:

```apache
postgres=> exit

student@instance-1:~$ 
```

## Task 2. Initialize the database

You are going to use your client VM as a platform to populate the database with data and host your application. The first step is to create a database and populate it with data.

### Create database

Create a database named `assistantdemo`.

**Note:** If your SSH session was terminated you need to reset your environment variables such as: export PGPASSWORD= export INSTANCE\_IP=

1. In the VM session execute:
    

```apache
psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres" -c "CREATE DATABASE assistantdemo"  
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres" -c "CREATE DATABASE assistantdemo"
CREATE DATABASE
student@instance-1:~$
```

2. Enable pgVector extension:
    

```apache
psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres dbname=assistantdemo" -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector"   
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ psql "host=$INSTANCE_IP user=postgres dbname=assistantdemo" -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
student@instance-1:~$
```

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Create a database and enable pgVector extension.

## Task 3. Install Python

next, you are going to use prepared Python scripts from GitHub repository, but before doing that, you need to install the required software.

1. In the VM execute:
    

```apache
sudo apt install -y python3.11-venv git
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ sudo apt install -y git build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
student@instance-1:~$ sudo apt install -y python3.11-venv git
python3 -m venv .venv

```

3. In the VM execute:
    

```apache
python -V
```

Expected console output:

```apache
(.venv) student@instance-1:~$ python -V
Python 3.11.2
(.venv) student@instance-1:~$ 
```

## Task 4. Populate Database

Clone the GitHub repository with the code for the retrieval service and sample application.

1. In the VM execute:
    

```apache
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/genai-databases-retrieval-app.git
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/genai-databases-retrieval-app.git
Cloning into 'genai-databases-retrieval-app'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 525, done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (289/289), done.
```

2. Prepare configuration file. In the VM execute:
    

```apache
cd genai-databases-retrieval-app/retrieval_service
cp example-config.yml config.yml
sed -i s/127.0.0.1/$INSTANCE_IP/g config.yml
sed -i s/my-password/$PGPASSWORD/g config.yml
sed -i s/my_database/assistantdemo/g config.yml
sed -i s/my-user/postgres/g config.yml
cat config.yml
```

**Note:** If your SSH session was terminated you need to set your environment variables such as: `export PGPASSWORD= REGION=us-central1 INSTANCE_IP=$(gcloud alloydb instances describe $ADBCLUSTER-pr --cluster=$ADBCLUSTER --region=$REGION --format="value(ipAddress)")`

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ cd genai-databases-retrieval-app/retrieval_service
cp example-config.yml config.yml
sed -i s/127.0.0.1/$INSTANCE_IP/g config.yml
sed -i s/my-password/$PGPASSWORD/g config.yml
sed -i s/my_database/assistantdemo/g config.yml
sed -i s/my-user/postgres/g config.yml
cat config.yml
host: 0.0.0.0
# port: 8080
datastore:
  # Example for AlloyDB
  kind: "postgres"
  host: 10.65.0.2
  # port: 5432
  database: "assistantdemo"
  user: "postgres"
  password: "P9..."
```

3. Now populate database with the sample dataset. In the VM execute:
    

```apache
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_database_init.py
```

The first command is adding all required packages to the Python virtual environment and the second command is populating the database with the data.

Expected console output(redacted):

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/retrieval_service$ pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_database_init.py
Collecting asyncpg==0.28.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))

Collecting fastapi==0.101.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 2))
...
database init done.
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/retrieval_service$
```

Populate database with the sample dataset.

## Task 5. Deploy the Retrieval Service to Cloud Run

Now you can deploy the retrieval service to Cloud Run. The service is responsible for working with the database. It extracts the necessary information from the database based on the request from an AI application.

### Create Service Account

Create a service account for the extension service and grant necessary privileges.

1. Open another Cloud Shell tab using the "+" at the top.
    

![Cloud Shell new tab +](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XK6xMce7ZgXzn6v%2Fq7JB5nG0tVpqGCRLPKhv6GbuBds%3D align="left")

2. In the new Cloud Shell tab execute:
    

```apache
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
gcloud iam service-accounts create retrieval-identity
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:retrieval-identity@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@cloudshell:~ (gleb-test-short-003)$ gcloud iam service-accounts create retrieval-identity
Created service account [retrieval-identity].
```

3. Close the tab by either execution command "exit" in the tab:
    

```apache
exit
```

Create the service account retrieval-identity.

## Task 6. Deploy the Retrieval Service

Continue in the first tab where you are connected to the VM through SSH by deploying the service.

1. In the VM SSH session execute:
    

```apache
cd ~/genai-databases-retrieval-app
gcloud alpha run deploy retrieval-service \
    --source=./retrieval_service/\
    --no-allow-unauthenticated \
    --service-account retrieval-identity \
    --region us-central1 \
    --network=default \
    --quiet
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app$ gcloud alpha run deploy retrieval-service \
    --source=./retrieval_service/\
    --no-allow-unauthenticated \
    --service-account retrieval-identity \
    --region us-central1 \
    --network=default
This command is equivalent to running `gcloud builds submit --tag [IMAGE] ./retrieval_service/` and `gcloud run deploy retrieval-service --image [IMAGE]`

Service URL: https://retrieval-service-onme64eorq-uc.a.run.app
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app$
```

### Verify The Service

Now we can check if the service runs correctly and the VM has access to the endpoint. We use gcloud utility to get the retrieval service endpoint. Alternatively you can check it in the cloud console and replace in the curl command the "$(gcloud run services list â€“filter="(retrieval-service)" by the value from there.

* In the VM SSH session execute:
    

```apache
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" $(gcloud  run services list --filter="(retrieval-service)" --format="value(URL)")
```

Expected console output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" $(gcloud  run services list --filter="(retrieval-service)" --format="value(URL)")
{"message":"Hello World"}student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app$
```

If you see the "Hello World" message it means your service is up and serving the requests.

Deploy the Retrieval Service.

## Task 7. Deploy sample application

When you have the retrieval service up and running, you can deploy a sample application which is going to use the service. The application can be deployed on the VM or any other service like Cloud Run, Kubernetes or even locally on a laptop.

Next you are going to deploy a sample application on the VM.

### Prepare the environment

First, add the necessary modules to Python.

* In the VM SSH session execute:
    

```apache
cd ~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/llm_demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Expected output (redacted):

```apache
student@instance-1:~$ cd ~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/llm_demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting fastapi==0.104.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
  Obtaining dependency information for fastapi==0.104.0 from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/db/30/b8d323119c37e15b7fa639e65e0eb7d81eb675ba166ac83e695aad3bd321/fastapi-0.104.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata
  Downloading fastapi-0.104.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (24 kB)
...
```

### Run Assistant application

Before starting the application you need to set up some environment variables. The basic functionality of the application, such as query flights and airport amenities, requires `BASE_URL` which points application to the retrieval service. We can get it using the gcloud command .

1. In the VM SSH session execute:
    

```apache
export BASE_URL=$(gcloud  run services list --filter="(retrieval-service)" --format="value(URL)")
```

Expected output (redacted):

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/llm_demo$ export BASE_URL=$(gcloud  run services list --filter="(retrieval-service)" --format="value(URL)")
```

### Prepare Client ID

To use more advanced capabilities of the application like booking and changing flights we need to sign-in to the application using our Google account and for that purpose we need to provide CLIENT\_ID environment variable using the OAuth client ID from the Prepare Client ID chapter:

To use booking functionality of the application we need to prepare OAuth 2.0 Client ID using Cloud Console. It will be when we sign into the application since booking is using clients credentials to record the booking data in the database.

1. In the Cloud Console go to the **APIs and Services** and click on "OAuth consent screen" and click **Get Started**.
    
2. Then follow on the next screen.

3. You need to fill out required fields such as "App name" and "User support email". Select **Internal** for "Audience" and finally the "Contact information".
    

![OAuth consent screen app information](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/uEAbA%2F7deFdY7%2BoHDIwCD9DruJk%2BudJkaXB3VFRfYA0%3D align="left")

4. Agree to the user data policy. Click **Continue** and then click **Create** at the bottom of the page and it will lead you to the next page.
    
5. The next step is to create the **client ID**. On the left panel you click "Clients" which lead you to the credentials for OAuth2.

6. Here you click "Create client" at the top. Then it will open another screen.

7. Pick up "Web application" from the dropdown list for application type and put your application URI (and port - optionally) as the "Authorized JavaScript origins". And you need to add to the "Authorized redirect URIs" your application host with "/login/google" at the end to be able to use the authorization popup screen.
    
8. After pushing the "Create" button.
    

We will need the Client ID (and optionally Client secret) later to use with your application.

```apache
export CLIENT_ID=450....apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Note:** Replace the CLIENT\_ID value with your Client Id that you just created.

Expected output (redacted):

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/llm_demo$ export CLIENT_ID=215....apps.googleusercontent.com
```

Create a Client Id.

Now you can run the application:

```apache
python run_app.py
```

Expected output:

```apache
student@instance-1:~/genai-databases-retrieval-app/llm_demo$ python main.py
INFO:     Started server process [28565]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8081 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Connect to the Application

You have several ways to connect to the application running on the VM. For example you can open port 8081 on the VM using firewall rules in the VPC or create a load balancer with public IP. Here we are going to use a SSH tunnel to the VM translating the local port 8080 to the VM port 8081.

1. Open another Cloud Shell tab using the sign "+" at the top.
    

![Cloud Shell new tab](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XK6xMce7ZgXzn6v%2Fq7JB5nG0tVpqGCRLPKhv6GbuBds%3D align="left")

2. In the new cloud shell tab start the tunnel to your VM by executing the `gcloud` command:
    

```apache
gcloud compute ssh instance-1 --zone=us-central1-c -- -L 8080:localhost:8081
```

It will show an error "Cannot assign requested address" - please ignore it.

Here is the expected output:

```apache
student@cloudshell:~ gcloud compute ssh instance-1 --zone=us-central1-a -- -L 8080:localhost:8081
bind [::1]:8081: Cannot assign requested address
linux instance-1.us-central1-a.c.gleb-codelive-01.internal 6.1.0-21-cloud-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.90-1 (2024-05-03) x86_64

```

It opens port 8080 in your Cloud Shell which can be used for the Web preview.

3. Click on the **Web preview** button on the right top of your Cloud Shell then select **Preview on port 8080**.
    

![Web preview port 8080](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/fmcyOSeMuv9LJ7nzu6JPnwQFph6uoPW2Em8lmZlH53I%3D align="left")

This opens a new tab in your web browser with the application interface. You should see the Cymbal Air Customer Service Assistant page. In the address bar of the page you'll see the URI to the preview page.

4. Remove the part `/?authuser=0&redirectedPreviously=true` at the end.
    

![web preview port 8080 URI](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/EOA71N9bPBSlM%2Br0EMqsgF6aUrTvAFaFVht5LLbaVhE%3D align="left")

Use the first part of URI like "https://8080-cs-35704030349-default.cs-us-east1-vpcf.cloudshell.dev/" is to be left in the browser window and to provide as the "Authorized JavaScript origins" and "Authorized redirect URIs" for our credentials created in the "Prepare Client ID" chapter replacing or adding to the originally provided http://localhost:8080 values. The upper value would look like "https://8080-cs-35704030349-default.cs-us-east1-vpcf.cloudshell.dev" and the lower one would be "https://8080-cs-35704030349-default.cs-us-east1-vpcf.cloudshell.dev/login/google"

## (Optional) Task 100 Sign into the application

1. Click the\_\_Sign in\_\_ button at the top right of the application screen to provide our credentials. That is optional and required only if you want to try booking functionality of the application.
    

This demo showcases the Cymbal Air customer service assistant. Cymbal Air is a fictional passenger airline. The assistant is an AI chatbot that helps travellers to manage flights and look up information about Cymbal Air's hub at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

It can help answer users questions like:

* When is the next flight to Denver?
    
* Are there any luxury shops around gate D50?
    
* Where can I get coffee near gate A6?
    
* Where can I buy a gift?
    

When you are signed in to the application you can try other capabilities like booking flights or check if the seat assigned to you is a window or aisle seat.

The application uses the latest Google foundation models to generate responses and augment it by information about flights and amenities from the operational AlloyDB database. You can read more about this demo application on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/genai-databases-retrieval-app) of the project.
