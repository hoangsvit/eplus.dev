Okay, let’s be honest.

If you’ve built even one Laravel project, you’ve definitely done this: Create model → migration → controller → form request → add routes …every. single. time.

It’s boring, right? And kinda repetitive.

Well, good news - here’s a quick Laravel 12 tip to save your time (and sanity): Let’s make an Artisan command that generates all the basic CRUD stuff for you in one go.

What This Command Does You give it a name like:

```apache
 php artisan make:crud Product
```

And it’ll auto-generate:

* A Model
    
* A Migration
    
* A Controller (resource-style)
    
* A Form Request
    
* And even add the route for you
    

No more copy-paste or switching between 5 terminal commands. One and done.

# **Step 1: Make the Command**

### **Run this:**

```apache
 php artisan make:command GenerateCrud
```

# **Step 2: Add the Logic**

### **Open up app/Console/Commands/GenerateCrud.php and drop this in:**

```php
 <?PHP

 namespace App\Console\Commands;

 use Illuminate\Console\Command;
 use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;
 use Illuminate\Support\Str;

 class GenerateCrud extends Command
 { 
     protected $signature = 'make:crud {name}';
     protected $description = 'Quickly generate CRUD files';

     public function handle(): void
     {
         $name = Str::studly($this->argument('name'));
         $table = Str::snake(Str::plural($name));
         $controller = "{$name}Controller";
         $request = "{$name}Request";

         // Create model + migration
         $this->call('make:model', ['name' => $name, '--migration' => true]);

         // Controller (resource style)
         $this->call('make:controller', [
             'name' => $controller,
             '--resource' => true,
             '--model' => $name,
         ]);

         // Form request
         $this->call('make:request', ['name' => $request]);

         // Route
         $route = "Route::resource('" . Str::kebab(Str::plural($name)) . "',  \\App\\Http\\Controllers\\$controller::class);";
         File::append(base_path('routes/web.php'), "\n" . $route);

         $this->info("All done! CRUD for {$name} created.");
     }
 }
```

# **Step 3: Register It**

### **In app/Console/Kernel.php, register the command:**

```php
 protected $commands = [
     \App\Console\Commands\GenerateCrud::class,
 ];
```

# **Step 4: Use It!**

```apache
 php artisan make:crud Blog
```

### **Done. You’ve got:**

* app/Models/Blog.php
    
* BlogController.php
    
* BlogRequest.php
    
* create\_blogs\_table migration
    
* Route in routes/web.php
    

### **Extra Sauce (Optional)**

**Want to take it further?**

* Auto-generate Blade views too (index, create, etc.)
    
* Add API version ( - api)
    
* Include soft deletes or timestamps
    

# **Final Thoughts**

Laravel 12 gives you the tools. But building a dev-friendly workflow? That’s on us.

This CRUD generator command is a small thing - but it makes a big impact. It saves time, keeps your structure consistent, and lets you focus on what matters: building features, not boilerplate. Whether you’re a solo dev or part of a team, this trick adds serious value to your Laravel toolbox.

**If you found this helpful, consider:**

* Bookmarking this page for future projects
    
* Sharing it with your Laravel developer group or team
    
* Commenting if you want an advanced version (like generating Blade views or API-only resources)
