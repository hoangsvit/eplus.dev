1. **The desired characteristics of a BDMS include (select all that apply):**
    
    * <mark>A flexible semi-structured data model</mark>
        
    * <mark>Continuous data ingestion</mark>
        
    * <mark>A full query language</mark>
        
    * Support for ACID
        
    * <mark>Support for common “Big Data” data types</mark>
        
    * Narrow range of query sizes
        
2. **Fill in the blank with the best answer: CAP theorem states that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ all at once within a distributed computer system?**
    
    * it is necessary to have consistency, accuracy, and partial tolerance
        
    * it is impossible to have consistency, accuracy, and partial tolerance
        
    * <mark>it is impossible to have consistency, availability, and partition tolerance</mark>
        
    * it is necessary to have consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
        
3. **What is the purpose of the acronym BASE?**
    
    * <mark>To impose properties on a BDMS in order to guarantee certain results.</mark>
        
    * Enables stricter enforcement of ACID type design.
        
    * To overcome CAP theorem.
        
    * The same as ACID.
        
4. **What are ziplists in Redis?**
    
    * A special type of data type that can store up to 512 mb of image data.

    * <mark>A compressed list that is stored within the value of the database.</mark>
        
    * A special type of data type that can store hashes that point to multiple attributes.
        
5. **What is one of the main features of Aerospike?**
    
    * Better equipped for string based search applications.
        
    * Enables real time data streaming from external sources.
        
    * <mark>Support for geospatial data storage and geospatial queries.</mark>
        
    * Images as values within the database.
        
6. **What database would be best suited for the following scenario: An app development company is trying to implement a cloud based storage system for their new map-based app. The cloud will manage the longitude and latitude of the data in order to track user location.**
    
    * Vertica
        
    * <mark>Aerospike</mark>
        
    * Redis
        
    * Solr

    * Vertica
        
    * Redis
        
    * Aerospike
