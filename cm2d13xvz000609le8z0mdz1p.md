    * Communicates and escalates 
        
    * Demonstrates flexibility

2. **Scenario: Planning a Corporate Retreat**
    
    An event planning team of five is tasked with planning a corporate retreat for a business with 85 employees. This retreat involves hundreds of to-dos, a large budget, client-initiated changes, and important discussions with the client. The project manager knows there is a lot to do, and they are ready to lead the way.
    
      
    Right from the beginning of the project, the project manager creates a spreadsheet to track what needs to get done in the project, and what teammates are working on. They also send status update emails twice per week to the stakeholders.
    
      
    The project has a $100,000 budget. There are many items to purchase and rent, including venue space, retreat materials, food, chairs, and tables. The project manager allows each one of their teammates up to $3,000 in expenses, with anything over requiring an approval.
    
      
    Shortly after the project begins, the client decides they want to slightly change the theme of the project to focus on the future instead of the past. The project manager has to work with several team members to implement the changes which include graphic design, retreat materials, and signage.
    
      
    Throughout the process of changing the theme of the retreat, the project manager works closely with the client by phone, email, chat, and video to ensure that the theme updates meet their expectations.
    
      
    There is an award-ceremony dinner at the end of the retreat. The deadline to finish scheduling the dinner is in two days. Several crucial decisions need to be made: the menu, lighting, and presentation music. To make sure the deadline is met, the project manager has a video meeting with the client to ensure the dinner choices meet their expectations.
