## **Overview**

* Labs are timed and cannot be paused. The timer starts when you click **Start Lab**.
    
* The included cloud terminal is preconfigured with the gcloud SDK.
    
* Use the terminal to execute commands and then click **Check my progress** to verify your work.
    

## **Challenge scenario**

* You're responsible for managing customer data in BigQuery. To ensure data protection and maintain historical backups, you need to automate the process of creating a copy of the customer table at regular intervals.
    
* Your objective is to construct a scheduled query on a monthly basis within Bigquery to backup data of the `Table1_name_filled_after_lab_start` table into a `Backup_table_name_filled_after_lab_start` table.
    
    * **Dataset:** `dataset_name_filled_after_lab_start`
        
    * **Table name:** `Table1_name_filled_after_lab_start`
        
    * **Backup Table name:** `Table2_name_filled_after_lab_start`
        

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.
