# Search Engine Optimization Concepts

Every website that needs to get featured in the Google Search Engine or any other search engine must implement Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Concepts optimally.

Let's see a few obstacles that a beginner/intermediate digital marketer might encounter through the learning process.

### Internal Links

Any links that you see on your website and on clicking on them redirect to the same website's articles or web pages.

### External Links / Outbound Links

Any links that you see on your website and on clicking on them redirect to the other website's domain articles or web pages.

### Back Links (Inbound / Incoming Links)

Any links that are pointed from other websites to your website. The more backlinks your website gets the more reachable and shown most when searched for.

### Referral Links

Any links that are used to promote the marketing campaigns of a company's brand or products. Most of the referral links won't be crawlable as the marketing campaigns will be done via some Ads, E-Mail, Social Media, and Websites.

The referrer ie the one who adds the company marketing links to their website may earn bonuses or points or benefits in some of the other ways from the company.

### Outbound Links

Any links that point to other websites from your website creates an outbound link to others' website. By doing this the others website will be much more recognized and given preference when searched in search engines.
