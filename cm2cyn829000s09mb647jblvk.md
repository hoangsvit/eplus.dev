### Week 1: Automation and Authentication

This week, you explore tools and practices that can help you automate tasks that you do in AWS. First, you learn about AWS CloudFormation so you can automate the creation of your infrastructure. Then, you learn about the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM). AWS SAM is an extension of CloudFormation you can use to automate both the infrastructure and packaging of your application. You also explore the use of Amazon Cognito for user sign-up and sign-in in an API-based application.

**Learning Objectives**

---

* Describe the benefits of automating the management of cloud infrastructure.
    
* Create a serverless API with AWS SAM that uses AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon DynamoDB.
    
* Describe the parts of an authenticated serverless application and API that uses Amazon Cognito and Amazon API Gateway.
    

---

1. **Which AWS service facilitates the use of infrastructure as code (IaC) for cloud development?**
    
    * Amazon CloudFront
        
    * <mark>AWS CloudFormation</mark>
        
    * Amazon Cognito
        
    * AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        
2. **What are reasons for using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) instead of AWS CloudFormation? (Select TWO.)**
    
    * <mark>AWS SAM uses a shorthand syntax for functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.</mark>
        
    * AWS SAM makes it possible to define resources by using a programming language model.
        
    * <mark>The AWS SAM CLI can automate the creation of an AWS Lambda package, including dependencies.</mark>
        
    * AWS SAM provides a more structured reuse format than CloudFormation.
        
    * AWS SAM can be used to automate the configuration and deployment of an AWS service.
        
3. **An application architect is building an application that requires users to create accounts and sign in to the application. Which AWS feature would help with this requirement?**
    
    * <mark>Amazon Cognito user pools</mark>
        
    * Amazon Cognito identity pools
        
    * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles
        
    * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
