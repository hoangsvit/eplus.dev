In the previous exercise, Managing a project in Github, you forked the repository, altered the file, used diff to inspect the changes toÂ class.txt. and pushed the file as a commit.

Reflect on the process.

1. **How does the diff command portray changes in a file?**
    
    * Diff only signifies additions.
        
    * <mark>Diff uses a plus (+) sign and a minus sign (-) to signify all changes.</mark>
        
    * Diff only signifies removals.
        
2. **What command did you use to change active directories?**
    
    * ad
        
    * cb
        
    * <mark>cd</mark>
        
3. **In what order do you run the commands to commit your file?**
    
    * push, commit
        
    * <mark>commit, push</mark>
