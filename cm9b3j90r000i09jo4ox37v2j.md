## Overview

In this lab, you use [Cloud Run functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and [Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/) to identify and clean up wasted cloud resources. You trigger a Cloud Run function to migrate a storage bucket from a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to a less expensive storage class.

Google Cloud provides [storage object lifecycle rules](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle) that automatically moves objects to different storage classes based on a set of attributes, such as their creation date or live state. However, these rules can’t take into account whether the objects have been accessed. Sometimes, you might want to move newer objects to Nearline storage if they haven’t been accessed for a certain period of time.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Create two storage buckets, add a file to the `serving-bucket`, and generate traffic against it.
    
* Create a Cloud Monitoring dashboard to visualize bucket utilization.
    
* Deploy a Cloud Run function to migrate the idle bucket to a less expensive storage class, and trigger the function by using a payload intended to mock a notification received from a Cloud alerting policy.
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Username"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Password"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `PROJECT_ID`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to "PROJECT_ID"
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: "ACCOUNT"

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = "PROJECT_ID"
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

3. Download the source code for the lab:
    

```apache
gcloud storage cp -r gs://spls/gsp649/* . && cd gcf-automated-resource-cleanup/
```

4. Set environment variables and make the repository folder your $WORKDIR where you run all commands related to this lab:
    

```apache
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)' 2>/dev/null)
WORKDIR=$(pwd)
```

5. Install [Apache Bench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html), an open source load-generation tool:
    

```apache
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils -y
```

## Task 2. Create the Cloud Storage buckets and add a file

1. In Cloud Shell, navigate to the `migrate-storage` directory:
    

```apache
cd $WORKDIR/migrate-storage
```

2. Create `serving-bucket`, the Cloud Storage bucket. You use this later to change storage classes:
    

```apache
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)' 2>/dev/null)
gcloud storage buckets create  gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket -l REGION
```

```

4. Add a text file to the bucket:
    

```apache
gcloud storage cp $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/testfile.txt  gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket
```

5. Make the file public:
    

```apache
gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket/testfile.txt
```

6. Confirm that you’re able to access the file:
    

```apache
curl http://storage.googleapis.com/${PROJECT_ID}-serving-bucket/testfile.txt
```

Your output will be:

```apache
this is a test
```

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

7. Create a second bucket called idle-bucket that won’t serve any data:
    

```apache
gcloud storage buckets create gs://${PROJECT_ID}-idle-bucket -l REGION
export IDLE_BUCKET_NAME=$PROJECT_ID-idle-bucket
```

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Create another Cloud Storage bucket

## Task 3. Create a monitoring dashboard

### Create a Monitoring Metrics Scope

Set up a Monitoring Metrics Scope that's tied to your Google Cloud Project. The following steps create a new account that has a free trial of Monitoring.

* In the Cloud Console, click **Navigation menu** (
    
    ![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D align="left")
    
    ) &gt; View All Products &gt; Observability &gt; **Monitoring**.
    

When the Monitoring **Overview** page opens, your metrics scope project is ready.

1. In the left panel, click **Dashboards** &gt; **Create Custom Dashboard**.
    
2. Name the Dashboard `Bucket Usage`.
    
3. Click **+ADD WIDGET**.
    
4. Click **Line**.
    
5. For **Widget Title**, type `Bucket Access`.
    
6. For **select a metric** &gt; **GCS Bucket &gt; Api &gt; Request count** metric and click **Apply**.
    

**Note:** If you cannot find the **Request count** metric, uncheck **Active**.

![Select a metric dashboard](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/D9fN4z1MoBwAgAk%2BJqqbFqt14BK1IWP83aH4067ekFE%3D align="left")

7. To group the metrics by bucket name, in the **Group By** drop-down list, select **bucket\_name** and click **ok**.
    
8. Click **\+ Add Filter**.
    

To filter by the method name:

* For **Filter By Metric Label**, select **method**.
    
* In the **dropdown** next to **method**, select **ReadObject**.
    
* Click **Apply**.
    

You’ve configured Cloud Monitoring to observe object access in your buckets. There's no data in the chart because there's no traffic to the Cloud Storage buckets.

## Task 4. Generate load on the serving bucket

Now that you configured monitoring, use Apache Bench to send traffic to `serving-bucket`.

1. In Cloud Shell, send requests to the object in the serving bucket:
    

```apache
ab -n 10000 http://storage.googleapis.com/$PROJECT_ID-serving-bucket/testfile.txt
```

2. In the left panel, click **Dashboards** and then click the name of your Dashboard that is **Bucket Usage** to see the Bucket Access chart.
    

**Note:** If you closed this tab earlier, select **Navigation menu** &gt; View All Products &gt; Observability &gt; **Monitoring**, and then in the left panel, click **Dashboards** &gt; **Bucket Usage**.

**Note:** Need to wait for at least 1 minute for the graph to appear on the **Bucket Usage** dashboard.

3. View traffic details.
    

![Bucket Usage dashboard](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/nxR5TD%2FlukvPSXlfa3D4FJq7NA24BXHKFxdw%2Bd6AIiQ%3D align="left")

You may need to enter **CTRL-C** to return to the command prompt.

## Task 5. Review and deploy the Cloud Run function

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command to view the Cloud Run function code that migrates a storage bucket to the Nearline storage class:
    

```apache
cat $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/main.py | grep "migrate_storage(" -A 15
```

The output is:

```apache
def migrate_storage(request):
    request_json = request.get_json(force=True)
    bucket_name = request_json['incident']['resource_name']

    print(f"bucket_name: {bucket_name}")  # Print the bucket name

    if not bucket_name:
        print("Error: bucket_name is empty")
        return "Invalid bucket name", 400

    storage_client = storage.Client(project)
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    bucket.storage_class = "NEARLINE"
    bucket.patch()
    return "Bucket migrated successfully", 200
```

Notice that the Cloud Run function uses the bucket name passed in the request to change it's storage class to Nearline.

2. Update the Python script to use your Project ID:
    

```apache
sed -i "s/<project-id>/$PROJECT_ID/" $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/main.py
```

3. Disable the Cloud Run functions API:
    

```apache
gcloud services disable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
```

4. Re-enable the Cloud Run functions API:
    

```apache
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
```

5. Export the project number:
    

```apache
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format="value(projectNumber)")
```

6. Add the `artifactregistry.reader` permission for your developer service account:
    

```apache
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member="serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/artifactregistry.reader"
```

7. Deploy the Cloud Run function:
    

```apache
gcloud functions deploy migrate_storage --gen2 --trigger-http --runtime=python39 --region Region
```

When prompted, enter `Y` to enable the API \[run.googleapis.com\] for the project and retry. Do the same for allowing unauthenticated invocations.

**Note:** If you see a permissions error, please wait a few minutes, and try the deployment again.

8. Capture the trigger URL into an environment variable that you use in the next section:
    

```apache
export FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe migrate_storage --format=json --region Region | jq -r '.url')
```

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Deploy the Cloud Run function

**Check my progress**

## Task 6. Test and validate alerting automation

1. Update the JSON file with the bucket name:
    

```apache
export IDLE_BUCKET_NAME=$PROJECT_ID-idle-bucket
sed -i "s/\\\$IDLE_BUCKET_NAME/$IDLE_BUCKET_NAME/" $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/incident.json
```

2. Send a test notification to the Cloud Run function you deployed using the `incident.json` file:
    

```apache
envsubst < $WORKDIR/migrate-storage/incident.json | curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" $FUNCTION_URL -d @-
```

The output is:

```apache
Bucket migrated successfully
```

The output isn’t terminated with a newline and therefore is immediately followed by the command prompt.

3. Confirm that the idle bucket was migrated to Nearline:
    

```apache
gsutil defstorageclass get gs://$PROJECT_ID-idle-bucket
```

The output is:

```apache
gs://<project-id>-idle-bucket: NEARLINE
```

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

Confirm the migration of bucket to Nearline
