1. **Optimized Performance:**
    
    * Leveraging static binaries for PHP, nginx, and dnsmasq, Herd boasts superior performance compared to other PHP development environments.
        
    * Developers can benefit from a claimed 35% faster test execution and 100% faster web request response times.
        
2. **All-Inclusive Package:**
    
    * Herd comes pre-packaged with essential components like PHP and nginx, eliminating the need for manual setup and configuration. This provides a hassle-free and efficient development experience.
        
3. **CLI Integration:**
    
    * The inclusion of Composer, Laravel installer, and Expose binaries in the Command-Line Interface (CLI) ensures immediate access to crucial tools for dependency management, Laravel installation, and project exposure.
        
4. **Terminal Management:**
    
    * Developers can conveniently handle site and service management directly from the terminal, aligning with the preferences of those who favor command-line interfaces for development tasks.
        
5. **Smooth Migration from Valet:**
    
    * Herd facilitates a seamless transition for developers currently using Laravel Valet. Existing Valet preferences are automatically migrated, allowing developers to switch to Herd without disruptions to their workflow.
        
6. **Intuitive UI for Configuration:**
    
    * The presence of an intuitive User Interface (UI) for configuration, encompassing settings for PHP versions and SSL certificates, enhances user-friendliness. This UI-driven approach simplifies the management of development environment preferences.
        

In summary, Herd is a developer-centric environment that prioritizes speed and user convenience. Its focus on providing a swift transition for Laravel developers accustomed to Valet, coupled with features like an intuitive UI and CLI integration, positions Herd as an appealing choice for macOS users seeking a high-performance Laravel development environment.
