## **Overview**

In this lab, you learn how to use Looker to query sorted and filtered data, create Looks, and add them to a Dashboard. For this lab, an Explore of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport data has been created for you. This dataset contains information on different attributes of airports such as city, date of commission, facility type, etc.

You can learn more about creating Explores from the [Exploring data in Looker documentation](https://docs.looker.com/exploring-data/exploring-data).

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Use filters to select desired data from Dimensions and Measures
    
* Create table visualizations on sorted and filtered data
    
* Save Explore queries as Looks
    
* Add Looks to a dashboard
    

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab‚Äîremember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have a personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to Looker

1. When ready, click **Start Lab**.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
    Notice your lab credentials in the Lab details pane. You use them to sign in to the Looker instance for this lab.
    
    **Note:** If you use other credentials, you will get **errors or incur charges**.
    
2. Click **Open Looker**.
    
3. Enter the provided Username and Password in the **Email** and **Password** fields.
    
    Username:
    
    ```javascript
    looker-developer@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    Copied!content\_copy
    
    Password:
    
    ```javascript
    YyzQk8yhmFv01Oo37BLSHrLjW4Iparf49u9KUFmqPck=
    ```
    
    Copied!content\_copy
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials from the Lab Details pane on this page. Do not use your Google Cloud Skills Boost credentials. If you have a personal Looker account, do not use it for this lab.
    
4. Click **Log In**.
    
    After a successful login, you see the Looker instance for this lab.
