### PHP Versions

The brew libraries do not support older PHP versions, so if you want to use an older version of PHP, you need to use one of brew's third-party libraries. Example:

[shivammathur/php](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php)

[phpbrew/phpbrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew)

This application uses shivammathur/php, by default it will automatically add shivammathur/php libraries to the brew, but due to 'network problems', it may fail to add them. You can add it by yourself, add command.

```apache
brew tap shivammathur/php
```
