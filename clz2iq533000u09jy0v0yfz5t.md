## **Overview**

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

## **Task 1**

**Create a bucket with Coldline Storage class**

1\. Create a Cloud storage bucket named as '**<mark>PROJECT_ID</mark>\-bucket**' with **Coldline Storage class** and replace the PROJECT\_ID in the bucket name with the project ID provided at the left side of the lab instructions.

* For '<mark>Bucket2</mark>' refer the bucket2 name provided at the left side of the lab instructions.
    
* Make sure that the updated file should be the same as previous file name.
    

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you're unable to view pre-created resources as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes."
