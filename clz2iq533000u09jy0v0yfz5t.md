## Overview

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

## Setup

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

**Note:** Once the lab environment has been fully provisioned, the tasks will become visible. The tasks that are assigned to you are independent, so you are free to perform the tasks in any order you want.

### Set the region

Set the project region for this lab:

```apache
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
```

**Note:** You've been assigned random tasks from the set of tasks. Please reference this **Form ID:** `form-2` and respective **Task Number** while reporting any issues, requesting assistance with these tasks or providing any feedback.

## Task 1: Create a Cloud storage bucket

1\. Create a Cloud storage bucket with named as '<mark>Bucket1</mark>', which is located at the left side of the lab instructions.

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

## Task 2: Publish Cloud Storage files to web

* Grant all users read permission for the object stored in '<mark>Bucket2</mark>', which will make it publicly available.
    
* For '<mark>Bucket2</mark>' refer the bucket2 name provided at the left side of the lab instructions. Instead of a bucket, grant all users read permissions to the object.
    

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Note: </strong>Instead of a bucket, grant all users read permissions to the object. In case you're unable to view pre-created resources as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes." If you do, just wait a short time and reload your page.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.
