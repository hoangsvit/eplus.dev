## **Overview**

In this unit, you'll learn how to perform CRUD operations by using Python. First, you'll learn how BSON documents are represented in Python. Next, you'll learn how to insert, query and retrieve, update, and delete documents in a Python application. Finally, you'll learn how to create a multi-document transaction.

### LESSON 1: WORKING WITH MONGODB DOCUMENTS IN PYTHON

1. **What Python data type is used to represent MongoDB documents? (Select one.)**
    
    **A.** Document
    
    **<mark>B.</mark>** <mark> Dictionary</mark>
    
    **C.** List
    
2. **You want to insert data stored in a Python dictionary to a new document in your MongoDB collection using the PyMongo driver. What do you need to do to convert a Python dictionary to BSON? (Select one.)**
    
    **<mark>A.</mark>** <mark> Nothing, the dictionary will be automatically converted by the driver to a MongoDB BSON document.</mark>
    
    **B.** Reference an independent library that will help you convert the data from a dictionary to BSON.
    
    **C.** Add an \_id field with an ObjectID value to the dictionary so it can be automatically converted to a MongoDB BSON document by the driver.
    

### LESSON 2: INSERTING A DOCUMENT IN PYTHON APPLICATIONS

1. **You need to insert a new restaurant into the**`restaurants`**collection. The new restaurant’s data is stored in a Python dictionary, stored in the variable name**`hyderabadi_biryani`**. Which of the following expressions will insert the new document into the**`restaurants`**collection? (Select one.)**
    
    **A.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = restaurants.insert_one(hyderabadi_biryani)
    ```
    
    **B.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = restaurants.insert(hyderabadi_biryani)
    ```
    
    **C.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = restaurants.insert_many(hyderabadi_biryani)
    ```
    
    **D.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = restaurants.insert.hyderabadi_biryani
    ```
    
    **<mark>A.</mark>** <mark> Option A</mark>
    
    **B.** Option B
    
    **C.** Option C
    
    **D.** Option D
    
2. **The**`sample_restaurants`**database is expanding to include restaurants in 5 new neighborhoods. You need to add documents for the 5 new neighborhoods in the neighborhoods collection. Documents for each new neighborhood are stored in the**`neighborhood_update`**variable. Which expression should you use to insert these documents into the collection? (Select one.)**
    
    **A.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_one(neighborhood_update)
    ```
    
    **B.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_many(neighborhood_update)
    ```
    
    **C.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = neighborhoods_collection.insert(neighborhood_update)
    ```
    
    **D.**
    
    ```javascript
    result = neighborhoods_collection.insert_one([neighborhood_one,neighborhood_two, neighborhood_three, neighborhood_four, neighborhood_5])
    ```
    
    **A.** Option A
    
    **<mark>B.</mark>** <mark> Option B</mark>

        account_id_receiver=None,
        account_id_sender=None,
        transfer_amount=None,
    ):
    
    accounts_collection = session.client.bank.accounts
    
    transfers_collection = session.client.bank.transfers
    
    transfer = {
        "transfer_id": transfer_id,
        "to_account": account_id_receiver,
        "from_account": account_id_sender,
        "amount": {"$numberDecimal": transfer_amount},
    }
    
    accounts_collection.update_one(
        {"account_id": account_id_sender},
        {
            "$inc": {"balance": -transfer_amount},
            $push": {"transfers_complete": transfer_id},
        },
        session=session,
    )
    
    accounts_collection.update_one(
        {"account_id": account_id_receiver},
        {
            "$inc": {"balance": transfer_amount},
            "$push": {"transfers_complete": transfer_id},
        },
        session=session,

        account_id_sender="MDB574189300",
        transfer_amount=100,
    )
    ```
    
    **If one of the operations fails, what will happen to the other operations in the transaction? (Select all that apply.)**
    
    **A.** The operations that did not fail will be reversed.
    
    **<mark>B.</mark>** <mark> The entire transaction will be canceled, and no operations will be committed.</mark>
    
    **C.** The entire transaction will complete, but only the operations that did not fail will be committed.
