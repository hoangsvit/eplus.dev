## **Overview**

The [Google APIs Explorer](http://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/) is a tool that helps you explore various Google APIs interactively. With the APIs Explorer, you can:

* Browse quickly through available APIs and versions.
    
* See methods available for each API and what parameters they support along with inline documentation.
    
* Execute requests for any method and see responses in real time.
    
* Make authenticated and authorized API calls.
    
* Search across all services, methods, and your recent requests to quickly find what you are looking for.
    

[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational PostgreSQL and MySQL databases in the cloud. Cloud SQL offers high performance, scalability, and convenience. Hosted on Google Cloud, Cloud SQL provides a database infrastructure for applications running anywhere.

In this lab, you will build a Cloud SQL instance and attach a MySQL database to it. After creating a sample CSV file and uploading it to Cloud Storage, you will create a table and pull the file’s contents into your MySQL database. Finally, you will remove the database and its associated data. You will accomplish these tasks with the Cloud SQL Admin API, where you will call various methods through the APIs Explorer tool.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will use the APIs Explorer tool to:

* Build a Cloud SQL instance.
    
* Configure a MySQL SQL database and attach it to a Cloud SQL instance.
    
* Pull CSV data from a Cloud Storage bucket and upload it to a MySQL database table.
    
* Delete a MySQL database.
    

### Prerequisites

This is a **fundamental level** lab. You should be familiar with the basic functioning and architecture of APIs. Experience with Google Cloud Shell and command line interface tools is recommended.

Familiarity with the APIs Explorer tool is also recommended. At a minimum, take the following labs before attempting this one:

* [Introduction to APIs in Google](https://google.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/1342)
    
* [APIs Explorer: Qwik Start](https://google.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/1241)
    

If you are unfamiliar with Cloud SQL, the labs [Cloud SQL for MySQL: Qwik Start](https://google.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/925) and [Introduction to SQL for BigQuery and Cloud SQL](https://google.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/1282) have valuable information that will orient you with the content of this lab. Once you're ready, scroll down and follow the steps below to get your lab environment set up.

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the **Lab Details** panel with the following:
    
    * The **Open Google Cloud console** button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Sign in** page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-fcca080921a0@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the **Username** in the **Lab Details** panel.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    FOq443Oral1H
    ```
    
    You can also find the **Password** in the **Lab Details** panel.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To view a menu with a list of Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** at the top-left.

```

4. Run the following command to switch over to your `mysql-db` database:
    

```apache
USE mysql-db;
```

You will now create a table in `mysql-db` so you can import data into a specific location.

5. Run the following command to create a table called `info`:
    

```apache
CREATE TABLE info (name VARCHAR(255), age INT, occupation VARCHAR(255));
```

You should receive a similar output:

```apache
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)
```

You have successfully created an empty table in your MySQL database.

**Do not exit out of this Cloud Shell session**.

6. Open a new tab in Cloud Shell by clicking the **+** tab in the top ribbon.
    

You will now create a CSV file and upload it to a Cloud Storage bucket.

7. Run the following command to create a file named `employee_info.csv`:
    

```apache
touch employee_info.csv
```

8. Now run the following command to edit `employee_info.csv`:
    

```apache

  "targetProject": "qwiklabs-gcp-a8af8f7d195267dd"
}
```

You have successfully added a CSV file to your MySQL database table using the APIs Explorer. You will now inspect this table.

## **Task 5. Inspect your updated database**

1. Return to the Cloud Console and return to your **MySQL Cloud Shell tab** that you left open. You will now see if the `info` table picked up the CSV file data.
    
2. Run the following command to view what's in the table:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM info;
```

You should receive a similar output:

```apache
+----------+------+----------------------+
| name     | age  | occupation           |
+----------+------+----------------------+
| Sean     |   23 |  "Content Creator"   |
| Emily    |   34 |  "Cloud Engineer"    |
| Rocky    |   40 |  "Event coordinator" |
| Kate     |   28 |  "Data Analyst"      |

| Jennifer |   32 |  "Web Developer"     |
+----------+------+----------------------+
6 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

With one API call in the Explorer tool, you were able to copy a CSV file located in Cloud Storage and merge it with a table in your MySQL database. This illustrates the power and efficiency of API method calls opposed to the multiple steps it would take in the Cloud Console.

## **Task 6. Delete your database**

You will now delete the MySQL database that hosts the employee information.

You have successfully deleted a database inside your Cloud SQL instance. Return to the Cloud Console for the following step.

### View your updated Cloud SQL instance

1. From the Cloud Console, from the Navigation menu select **SQL**, which is located under the Databases header. This will bring you to the instances page.
    
2. Click on **my-instance**, then click on the **databases** tab. You will see a list of databases with `mysql-db` removed.
