### About this Course

A modern software engineer knows how to use the benefits of managed services from Amazon Web Services to reduce the coding needed to get a project across the line. There’s a lot of code you really don’t need to write when you can use a managed service for your applications. Less code means less tests, less bugs, and quicker delivery. In this course, we get hands on with automation tools and serverless managed services. Get your projects completed faster without needing to maintain the underlying servers hosting the managed services. Treat your infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Serverless Application Model as an automated way to build the resources hosting your applications. We use AWS Amplify to rapidly add front-end hosting and AWS Cognito to add authentication to our application. With Cognito in place, we upgrade the application API to require authentication. Next, we learn to use AWS Step Functions to move a lot of the workflow coordination code out of your applications. Using serverless services, we contrast some options for building event driven architectures with Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS and Amazon EventBridge. Join our expert instructors as we dive deep on real-world use cases for each of the featured services in the course. This course will provide a combination of video-based lectures, demonstrations and hands-on lab exercises that will get you working with automation tools, Cognito authentication, Step Function workflows and event-driven architectures.
