## **Overview**

This lab provides a hands-on introduction to fine-tuning Gemini generative models using Vertex AI's Supervised Tuning feature. You'll learn how to leverage your own labeled data to refine a base Gemini model, adapting it to excel at specific tasks like classification, summarization, question answering, and chat.

The fine-tuning process involves these key steps:

* **Data Preparation:** Providing high-quality, well-labeled training data is crucial. Your data directly influences the model's performance and helps mitigate potential biases.
    
* **Training:** Experiment with different training configurations to optimize the model for your target task. This iterative process allows you to maximize the model's potential.
    
* **Evaluation:** Carefully select evaluation metrics and a separate dataset to accurately assess the fine-tuned model's performance.
    

**Recommended Configurations:**

To guide your fine-tuning journey, we provide recommended starting points for various tasks:

| **Task** | **Examples in Dataset** | **Epochs** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classification | 500+ | 2-4 |
| Summarization | 1000+ | 2-4 |
| Extractive QA | 500+ | 2-4 |
| Chat | 1000+ | 2-4 |

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should be familiar with:

* Basic Python programming.
    
* General API concepts.
    
* Running Python code in a Jupyter notebook on [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction).
    

## **Objectives**

In this lab, you will:

* Understand the process to utilize supervised fine-tuning.
    
* Enhance results from Gemini using data from BigQuery.
    
* Fine-tune Gemini using question & answer data from StackOverflow.
    

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-bfc71c7a430a@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    cJ4qNckZwmGD
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.
