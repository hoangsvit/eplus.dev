### A quick but very important reminder ⛔:

Please D**O NOT share screenshots** of the **Prize Counter mail** that contain your **unique order links**.

We’ve seen cases in the past where someone else used that link to order the swags — and once that happens, nothing can be done to reverse it. So please be careful and keep your mail private.

Also, **don’t panic** if the **website crashes** or takes time to load once mails are rolled out. That’s expected due to high traffic. Just keep trying, refresh patiently — and relax, swags won’t run out of stock. 🎁💪

### ⚠️ Whitesquare Website Error – Please Read ⚠️

Hi everyone!

If you’re seeing an error like “**Error establishing a database connection**” while opening the prize redemption link — **don’t worry!**

This is happening because many people are trying to claim their prizes at the same time, which is causing temporary server overload.

✅ Your prize is not out of stock and your link is still valid.

⏳ Just wait a while and try again later. The site will be back once the traffic reduces. Please keep patience and avoid multiple retries at the same time.

📌 Reminder: Do not share your prize link with anyone. It’s unique to you.

Thanks for understanding! 🙏
