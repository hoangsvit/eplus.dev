## **Overview**

There are a number of cloud-native methods to allow inter-VPC communication in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In this lab, you will create multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) deployed in a “hub and spoke” typology. You will deploy a hub resource (VM running a simple web service) as well as VMs in 4 different spoke VPCs. You will then connect each spoke VPC to the hub VPC to access that resource using three different methods: VPC Peering, Private Service Connect (PSC), and HA-VPN.

![img1.jpg](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/8ydaJ%2FFIiwXNYkp6Q%2FOne8IBgbMTQeWHx9aArESzkx4%3D align="left")

In addition, this lab will demonstrate how the Network Connectivity Center (NCC) can be used to connect some of the spokes using a centralized management plane. Lastly, to complete this lab, you will test connectivity using both active Virtual Machines (VMs) as well as simulated tests using Connectivity Tests through Network Intelligence Center.

## **Setup**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

#### **What you need**

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended)
    
* Time to complete the lab
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use the same account/project for this lab to avoid incurring charges.

**Note:** If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the **Lab details** pane, which is populated with the temporary credentials that are needed for this lab.
    
    ![Lab details pane](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/X9VIhq30lLh0ABWYXdr4mpMXlHe7E9tI0VX5FmbBw%2Fo%3D align="left")
    
2. Copy the **Password** and then click **Open Google Cloud console**. The lab spins up resources, then opens another tab that shows the **Sign in** page.
    
    **Tip:** Open the tabs in separate windows, side by side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the Choose an account page, click **Use another account.**
    
3. On the **Sign in** page, verify that the username from the **Lab details** pane is auto-filled. Click **Next**.
    
4. Paste the password in the **Enter your password field**. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** Use the credentials from the **Lab details** pane. Using your personal Google Cloud account may incur charges to your account.
    
5. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Understand your account management.
        
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        

After a few moments, the console opens.

**Note:** You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud products and services by clicking the **Navigation menu** in the top left.

![Google Cloud console menu with the Navigation menu icon highlighted](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/kE97FtpO7sdrgsE85dTUvzeTyUA3B%2B%2B4lEMji21lHEk%3D align="left")

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine (VM) that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. In the Cloud Console, in the top-right toolbar, click the **Activate Cloud Shell** button.
    

![Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vdY5e%2Fan9ZGXw5a%2FZMb1agpXhRGozsOadHURcR8thAQ%3D align="left")

2. Click **Continue**.
    

![cloudshell_continue.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lr3PBRjWIrJ%2BMQnE8kCkOnRQQVgJnWSg4UWk16f0s%2FA%3D align="left")

It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your *PROJECT\_ID*. For example:

![Cloud Shell Terminal](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hmMK0W41Txk%2B20bQyuDP9g60vCdBajIS%2B52iI2f4bYk%3D align="left")

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

**Output:**

```apache
Credentialed accounts:
 - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
```

**Example output:**

```apache
Credentialed accounts:
 - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
```

4. You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = <project_ID>
```

**Example output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud` see the [gcloud command-line tool overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

#### **Step 1:**

* In this step, you need to create the Spoke4 VPC and the required resources within the Spoke1 VPC. You should create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network, Subnet, Firewall rules, Virtual Machine (VM) instance, and PSC endpoint.
    

#### **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network and Subnet**

Create the spoke4-vpc VPC network and the subnet. To make sure that there are no IP overlaps and conflicts, we recommend using the IP range listed in the table below.

| **Service** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| VPC Network name | spoke4-vpc |
| Subnet | spoke4-subnet |
| Region | us-central1 |
| IP Range | 10.4.1.0/24 |

#### **Create a Firewall Rule**

Create a firewall rule to allow ssh traffic from Identity Aware Proxy (IAP)

| **Service** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Firewall Rule name | spoke4-firewall |
| Network | spoke4-vpc |
| Targets | All instances in the network |
| Source IPV4 ranges | 35.235.240.0/20 |
| Ports and Protocols | tcp 22 |

#### **Create a Virtual Machine (VM) Instance**

Create the spoke4-vm instance. Later in the lab, you will use this VM to test connectivity to other VPC networks.

| **Service** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| VM instance name | spoke4-vm |
| Region | us-central1 |
| Zone | us-central1-a |
| Machine Type | e2-medium |
| Network Interface | spoke4-vpc |

#### **Step 2:**

* In this step, you should create a Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint to consume the Web service in hub-vpc.
    

| **Service** | **Name** |
| --- | --- |
| TARGET | Published Service |
| Target Service | \[SERVICE ATTACHMENT\] |
| Endpoint Name | pscendpoint |
| Network | spoke4-vpc |
| Subnet | spoke4-subnet |
| IP Address | \[CREATE NEW IP\] |

NOTE: Value for Target Service is easily found by going to the Published Service created in Task1 and copying the Service Attachment URL.

#### **Step 3:**

#### **Test Connectivity**

In this section perform connectivity tests

1. Copy the Address of the Private Service Connect endpoint.
    
2. Connect to spoke4-vm and check the connection.
    
3. Navigate to VM instances console by clicking **Navigation Menu** &gt; **Compute Engine** &gt; **VM instances**.
    

**SSH** into `spoke4-vm` instance.

4. In the SSH shell of `spoke4-vm`, run the following command replacing `<IP_OF_PSC_ENDPOINT>` with the endpoint IP:
    

```apache
curl -I <IP_OF_PSC_ENDPOINT>
```

* You should see similar output.
    

```apache
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## **Task 6: Create Connectivity Tests to Use Network Intelligence Center**

#### **Step 1:**

* Connectivity Tests is a diagnostics tool that lets you check connectivity between network endpoints. In this step, you should create a connectivity test with the below configurations.
    

Create the following connectivity test and observe the output of each test:

1. **test-spoke1-hub** : Source will be the spoke1-vm and destination will be hub-vm. Protocol is ICMP. You can also choose to test connectivity to the hub-vm or the hubILB on port 80.
    
2. **test-spoke2-hub** : Source will be the spoke2-vm and destination will be hub-vm. Protocol is ICMP. You can also choose to test connectivity to the hub-vm or the hubILB on port 80.
    
3. **test-spoke3-hub** : Source will be the spoke3-vm and destination will be hub-vm. Protocol is ICMP. You can also choose to test connectivity to the hub-vm or the hubILB on port 80.
    
4. **test-spoke2-spoke3** : Source will be the spoke2-vm and destination will be spoke3-vm. Protocol is ICMP.
    
5. **test-spoke4-hub** : Source will be the spoke4-vm and destination will be PSC endpoint IP in spoke4-vpc. Protocol is TCP port 80.
    

* At a minimum, you should configure the following 5 tests.
    

| **Name** | **Source** | **Destination** | **Protocol** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| test-spoke1-hub | spoke1-vm | hub-vm | ICMP |
| test-spoke2-hub | spoke2-vm | hub-vm | ICMP |
| test-spoke3-hub | spoke3-vm | hub-vm | ICMP |
| test-spoke2-spoke3 | spoke2-vm | spoke3-vm | ICMP |
| test-spoke4-hub | spoke4-vm | IP of spoke4-vpc  
PSC endpoint | TCP 80 |

Click *Check my progress*

Check the Connectivity test.
