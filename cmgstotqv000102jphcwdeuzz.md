## Overview

* Labs are timed and cannot be paused. The timer starts when you click **Start Lab**.
    
* The included cloud terminal is preconfigured with the gcloud SDK.
    
* Use the terminal to execute commands and then click **Check my progress** to verify your work.
    

## Challenge scenario

* You're a cloud architect for a media company. A critical video archive bucket named `qwiklabs-gcp-01-bfbfad5afdd7`\-urgent has mistakenly been made public. Your task is to quickly secure it in the provided time frame.
