1. **What did you need to install in order to create routes?**
    
    * <mark>react-router-dom</mark>
        
    * three.js
        
    * router-dom
        
    * react-dom
        
2. **Instead of anchor tags, what tag did you use with React Router?**
    
    * the to attribute
        
    * <mark>the Link tag</mark>
        
    * the element attribute
        
    * the To tag
        
3. **What's wrong with this code?**
    
    ```xml
    <Link to="/" className="nav-item" href="/">
      Home
    <Link>
    ```
    
    * The **to** attribute can't have just the **"/"** value.
        
    * <mark>The </mark> **<mark>href</mark>** <mark> attribute should not be used here.</mark>
        
    * You cannot have hyphens in the value of the **className** attribute.
