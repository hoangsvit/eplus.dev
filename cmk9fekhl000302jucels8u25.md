## Overview

* Labs are timed and cannot be paused. The timer starts when you click **Start Lab**.
    
* The included cloud terminal is preconfigured with the gcloud SDK.
    
* Use the terminal to execute commands and then click **Check my progress** to verify your work.
    

## Challenge scenario

* You have an existing Cloud Storage bucket named `qwiklabs-gcp-01-92c132ab20c5-bucket` that contains the following files necessary for a simple static website:
    
    * index.html (The main landing page)
        
    * error.html (Custom error page)
        
    * style.css
        
    * logo.jpg
        
* Currently, the bucket is not configured for website hosting. Your task is to update the configuration to make this website publicly accessible.
    
* As of now, there is no need to create a load balancer or CDN to redirect the request to the cloud storage bucket.
