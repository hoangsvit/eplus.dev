### Multi-host support

At ServBay, you can add multiple hosts. Each host can configure different environments and domain names according to their actual business needs. Additionally, you can choose the HTTP/HTTPS protocol according to your requirements, or customize your own ports. You have the freedom to select your host type as PHP, static, reverse proxy, or redirect to another URL. You can also quickly switch between different PHP versions to test how your code performs in different environments.
