## **Overview**

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students enrolled in the [Build a Data Warehouse with BigQuery](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/624) skill badge.

### Setup

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

**Note:** Once the lab environment has been fully provisioned, the tasks will become visible. The tasks that are assigned to you are independent, so you are free to perform the tasks in any order you want.

## **Challenge scenario**

You are part of an international public health organization which is tasked with developing a machine learning model to predict the daily case count for countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a junior member of the Data Science team you've been assigned to use your data warehousing skills to develop a table containing the features for the machine learning model.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for this task, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.

## **Task 1**

## Create a table partitioned by date

The starting point for the machine learning model will be the **oxford\_policy\_tracker** table in the [COVID 19 Government Response public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_govt_response&page=dataset) which contains details of different actions taken by governments to curb the spread of Covid-19 in their jurisdictions.

Given the fact that there will be models based on a range of time periods, you have to create a dataset and then create a date partitioned version of the **oxford\_policy\_tracker** table in your newly created dataset, with an expiry time set to **1080** days.

While creating a table, you have also been instructed to exclude the United Kingdom ( alpha\_3\_code=**GBR**), Brazil ( alpha\_3\_code=**BRA**), Canada ( alpha\_3\_code=**CAN**) & the United States of America (alpha\_3\_code=**USA**) as these will be subject to more in-depth analysis through nation and state specific analysis.

1. Create a new dataset **covid** and create a table **oxford\_policy\_tracker** in that dataset partitioned by date, with an expiry of **1080** days. The table should initially use the schema defined for the **oxford\_policy\_tracker** table in the [COVID 19 Government Response public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_govt_response&page=dataset) .
    
2. You must also populate the table with the data from the source table for all countries and exclude the United Kingdom (**GBR**), Brazil (**BRA**), Canada (**CAN**) and the United States (**USA**) as instructed above.

## **Task 2**

## Populate the mobility record data

In this task, you need to add the **mobility** record data, which requires to extract average values for the six component fields that comprise the mobility record data from the **mobility\_report** table from the [Google COVID 19 Mobility public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_google_mobility&page=dataset) .

Your coworker has also given you a SQL snippet that is currently being used to analyze trends in the Google Mobility data daily mobility patterns. You might need to use this as part of the query that will add the daily country data for the mobility record in table provided in the task description.

```sql
SELECT country_region, date,
AVG(retail_and_recreation_percent_change_from_baseline) as avg_retail,
AVG(grocery_and_pharmacy_percent_change_from_baseline) as avg_grocery,
AVG(parks_percent_change_from_baseline) as avg_parks,
AVG(transit_stations_percent_change_from_baseline) as avg_transit,
AVG( workplaces_percent_change_from_baseline ) as avg_workplace,
AVG( residential_percent_change_from_baseline) as avg_residential
FROM bigquery-public-data.covid19_google_mobility.mobility_report
GROUP BY country_region, date
```

1. Verify the pre-created BigQuery dataset '**covid\_data**' within this dataset, populate the mobility record in '**consolidate\_covid\_tracker\_data**' table with data from the [Google COVID 19 Mobility public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_google_mobility&page=dataset) .
    

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you're unable to view pre-created resources in bigquery as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes." If you do, just wait a short time and reload your page.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Task 3**

## Query missing data in population & country\_area columns

In this task, you need to find out the countries which do not have population data and countries that do not have country area information.

1. Within the BigQuery dataset named '**covid\_data**' contains one table named **oxford\_policy\_tracker\_worldwide**, run a query to find the missing countries in the population and country\_area data from '**oxford\_policy\_tracker\_worldwide**' table . The query should list countries that do not have any population data and countries that do not have country area information, ordered by country name. If a country has neither population or country area it must appear twice.
    

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you're unable to view pre-created resources in bigquery as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes." If you do, just wait a short time and reload your page.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Task 4**

## Create a new table for country population data

In this step, you need to create a copy of **covid\_19\_geographic\_distribution\_worldwide** table from **European Center for Disease Control COVID 19 public dataset** into your dataset provided in the task description.

1. Create a new table '**pop\_data\_2019**' within the dataset named as '**covid\_data**'. The table should initially use the schema defined for the '**covid\_19\_geographic\_distribution\_worldwide**' table data from the [European Center for Disease Control COVID 19 public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_ecdc&page=dataset).
    
2. Add the country population data to the '**pop\_data\_2019**' table with **covid\_19\_geographic\_distribution\_worldwide** table data from the [European Center for Disease Control COVID 19 public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_ecdc&page=dataset).
    

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you're unable to view pre-created resources in bigquery as per the task description,"your Google Cloud resources are still being provisioned, please refresh the page and try again in a few minutes." If you do, just wait a short time and reload your page.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Tips and tricks**

* **Tip 1**. Remember that if you are instructed to create table you must exclude the United Kingdom (`GBR`), Brazil (`BRA`), Canada (`CAN`) and the United States (`USA`) data.
    
* **Tip 2**. If you are updating the schema for a BigQuery table you can use the console to add the columns and record elements or you can use the command line `bq`utility to update the schema by providing a JSON file with all of field definitions as explained [in the BigQuery Standard SQL reference documentation.](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managing-table-schemas#manually_adding_an_empty_column)
    
* **Tip 3**. The `covid19_ecdc` table in the [European Center for Disease Control COVID 19 public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=covid19_ecdc&page=dataset) contains a `population` column that you can use if you are populating the `population`column based on your task description.
    
* **Tip 4**. The `country_names_area` table from the [Census Bureau International public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=census_bureau_international&page=dataset) does not contain a three letter country code column, but you can join it to table provided in task description using the full text `country_name` column that exists in both tables.
    
* **Tip 5**. If you are updating the mobility record remember that you must select (and average) a number of records for each country and date combination so that you get a single average of each child column in the mobility record. You must join the resulting data to your working table using the same combination of country name and date that you used to group the source mobility records to ensure there is a unique mapping between the averaged source mobility table results and the records in your table that have a single entry for each country and date combination.
    
* **TIP 6**. The UNION option followed by the ALL keyword combines the results of two queries where each query lists distinct results without combining duplicate results that arise from the union into a single row.
