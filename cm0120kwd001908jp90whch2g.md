## **Overview**

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the [Develop Serverless Applications on Cloud Run](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/741) course. Are you ready for the challenge?

## **Setup**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

## **Challenge scenario**

Pet Theory, a veterinary practice, is eager to adopt serverless architecture for modernizing their current systems.

In this challenge lab, as a member of the development team, your assignment is to transition a specific service to a serverless framework. It's crucial to follow the detailed instructions given to accomplish this task successfully.

### Architecture overview

For this project, Pet Theory has selected their current monolithic Billing application to undergo transformation into a serverless model.

Throughout this lab, your responsibility is to execute this architectural upgrade, ensuring a seamless transition to the serverless design.

![Architecture diagram](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/iqU2yEJH%2FtmFyBvZoE0PWT5iiCUSefFq2EcCvRcAeuQ%3D align="left")

The development team will provide either the code or an image to be deployed as part of the solution.

## **Developing a minimal viable product (MVP)**

You will build a prototype solution for Pet Theory that meets the following high level requirement specification:

| **Ref** | **Definition of Done** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Deploy Staging Architecture |
| 2 | Deploy Prod Architecture |
| 3 | Secure Access between components in the Prod Architecture |

## **Provision the lab environment**

During the lab, ensure the environment is provisioned to support the deployment of the resources.

1. Open a [Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?&shellonly=true) in an Incognito Browser Window.
    
2. Set the default project for the environment:
    

```apache
gcloud config set project \
$(gcloud projects list --format='value(PROJECT_ID)' \
--filter='qwiklabs-gcp')
```

3. Set the region for the run deployments:
    

```apache
gcloud config set run/region us-west1
```

4. Set the Cloud Run platform type:
    

```apache
gcloud config set run/platform managed
```

5. Clone the repo with the Pet Theory code:
    

```apache
git clone https://github.com/rosera/pet-theory.git && cd pet-theory/lab07
```

**Note:** You have been given access to the development repository. Note the location and use the assets to build to the stated requirement.
