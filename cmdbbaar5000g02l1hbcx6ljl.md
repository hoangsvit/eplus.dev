## Overview

In this lab, you learn how to use Google Meet to create a meeting and live stream, how to configure different Google Meet features, as well as how to use the Google Workspace Console to configure access to Google Meet.

### Objectives

In this lab, you use Google Meet to do the following:

* Create a meeting and live stream
    
* Explore Google Meet features
    
* Configure and test Google Meet features
    
* Configure and test Google Meet access
    

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with basic Google Workspace terminology helps maximize your learning.

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Start your lab

When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left.

### Sign in to the Google Workspace Admin Console

To access the Google Workspace Admin Console, you must find your credentials and then sign in.

#### Find your lab's User Email and Password

To access the resources and console for this lab, locate the **User Email** and **Password** in the Lab Details panel. This panel is on the left or at the top, depending on the width of the browser window. Use these credentials to log in to the Google Workspace Admin Console.

If your lab requires other resource identifiers or connection-related information, they appear on this panel as well.

#### Sign in to the Admin Console

1. Click **Open Google Workspace Admin Console**.
    

***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

**Note:** If you see the **Verify your account** dialog:

* Click **Next**.
    
* Click the prefilled user.
    
* Click **Use another account**.
    

2. On the Sign in page, log in using the **User Email** and **Password** details provided.
    
3. When prompted, click **I understand** and **ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICE** to accept all terms and conditions.
    

After a few seconds, the *Admin Console* opens.

4. Right-click **VERIFY DOMAIN** in either the yellow box at the top or the red box in the *Domains* card, and select **Open link in new tab**.
    
    **Note:** To complete this step in a real-life scenario, you'd need to add an actual DNS record.
    
5. Click the new tab, called **Domain setup**, to complete the Google Workspace domain verification steps.
    
6. On the *Let's set up your domain* page, click **Get Started**.
    
7. Select the **My domain uses a different host** checkbox and then click **Continue**.
    
8. At the bottom of the *Add verification code* page, select the **Come back here and confirm once you have updated the code on your domain host** checkbox, and then click **Confirm**.
    
9. Wait until it says **Your domain is verified!** and then close the *Domain setup* tab.
    
    **Note:** Do not click **Activate Gmail**.
    
10. Return to the **Admin Console** tab and refresh the page.
