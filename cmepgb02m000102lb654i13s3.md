## Overview

Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. Operations that used to take hours or days take seconds or minutes instead. Create Dataproc clusters quickly and resize them at any time, so you don't have to worry about your data pipelines outgrowing your clusters.

This lab shows you how to use the command line to create a Dataproc cluster, run a simple [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) job in the cluster, and then modify the number of workers in the cluster.

### What you'll do

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Create a Dataproc cluster using the command line
    
* Run a simple Apache Spark job
    
* Modify the number of workers in the cluster
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-00-abd43b6494c9@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    Bd8MPhemuQqI
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-03-9adf0dd80db9`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-03-9adf0dd80db9
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-00-abd43b6494c9@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-03-9adf0dd80db9
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## Task 1. Create a cluster

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to set the Region:
    

```apache
gcloud config set dataproc/region us-central1
```

2. Dataproc creates staging and temp buckets that are shared among clusters in the same region. Since we're not specifying an account for Dataproc to use, it will use the Compute Engine default service account, which doesn't have storage bucket permissions by default. Let's add those.
    

* First, run the following commands to grab the PROJECT\_ID and PROJECT\_NUMBER:
    

```apache
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project) && \
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)')
```

* Now run the following command to give the Storage Admin role to the Compute Engine default service account:
    

```apache
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member=serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role=roles/storage.admin
```

3. Enable Private Google Access on your subnetwork by running the following command:
    

```apache
gcloud compute networks subnets update default --region=us-central1  --enable-private-ip-google-access
```

4. Run the following command to create a cluster called `example-cluster` with e2-standard-4 VMs and default Cloud Dataproc settings:
    

```apache
gcloud dataproc clusters create example-cluster --worker-boot-disk-size 500 --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-4 --master-machine-type=e2-standard-4
```

5. If asked to confirm a zone for your cluster. Enter **Y**.
    

Your cluster will build for a couple of minutes.

```apache
Waiting for cluster creation operation...done.
Created [... example-cluster]
```

When you see a "Created" message, you're ready to move on.

### Test completed task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have successfully created a Dataproc cluster, you will see an assessment score.

## Task 2. Submit a job

* Run this command to submit a sample Spark job that calculates a rough value for pi:
    

```apache
gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark --cluster example-cluster \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --jars file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar -- 1000
```

The command specifies:

* That you want to run a [spark](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/jobs/submit/spark) job on the `example-cluster` cluster
    
* The `class` containing the main method for the job's pi-calculating application
    
* The location of the jar file containing your job's code
    
* The parameters you want to pass to the job—in this case, the number of tasks, which is `1000`
    

**Note:** Parameters passed to the job must follow a double dash (--). See the [gcloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/jobs/submit/spark) for more information.

The job's running and final output is displayed in the terminal window:

```apache
Waiting for job output...
...
Pi is roughly 3.14118528
...
state: FINISHED
```

### Test completed task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have successfully submitted a job, you will see an assessment score.

Submit a job

## Task 3. Update a cluster

1. To change the number of workers in the cluster to four, run the following command:
    

```apache
gcloud dataproc clusters update example-cluster --num-workers 4
```

Your cluster's updated details are displayed in the command's output:

```apache
Waiting on operation [projects/qwiklabs-gcp-7f7aa0829e65200f/regions/global/operations/b86892cc-e71d-4e7b-aa5e-6030c945ea67].
Waiting for cluster update operation...done.
```

2. You can use the same command to decrease the number of worker nodes:
    

```apache
gcloud dataproc clusters update example-cluster --num-workers 2
```

Now you can create a Dataproc cluster and adjust the number of workers from the `gcloud` command line on the Google Cloud.

## Task 4. Test your understanding

Below are multiple-choice questions to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer them to the best of your abilities.

Clusters can be created and scaled quickly with a variety of virtual machine types, disk sizes, and number of nodes.TrueFalse
