## **Overview**

This lab demonstrates how to create and deploy an AI-powered chat application using Cloud Run on Google Cloud. The chat application is powered by the PaLM 2 Chat Bison Large Language Model's (LLM) (text-chat) APIs.

You will leverage the APIs in a web application and deploy it to Cloud Run, using Cloud Build and Artifact Repository to store the container image of the application build. The application can be used as a starting point for web interfaces using the PaLM2 APIs.

**What you will learn:**

In this lab, you will create a web application that runs on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) which utilizes APIs provided by the [PaLM 2 for text (Chat Bison)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-chat) Large Language Model (LLM) and surfaces them through a simple web interface deployed in the lab.

After this lab you will gain an understanding of how to build a web application which can utilize Large Language Models like the Chat Bison model to create engaging, conversation based interactions with end users who can asks questions and receive insightful responses through the chat application.

To complete the lab you will:

* Build a Docker image to run the application using Cloud Build
    
* Deploy a Cloud Run service that executes the application
    
* Review python code to understand how the application utilizes the `Chat Bison` model
    

Let's begin!

---

### **Task 1. Environment Setup**

In order to deploy the Cloud Run application we will download the source from a Cloud Storage bucket.

1. Open a new **Cloud Shell** terminal and execute the following command.
    

```apache
gsutil cp -R gs://spls/gsp1201/chat-flask-cloudrun .
```

2. Next, navigate to the folder of the project.
    

```apache
cd chat-flask-cloudrun
```

3. Set the region and project environment variables referenced by subsequent commands.
    

```apache
export PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-01-9a291b3ad02a
export REGION=us-central1
```

### **Task 2. Build a Docker image**

Next, you will build a Docker image for the application and push it to [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/container-concepts). Once built and stored you will reference the container image to deploy the application to Cloud Run.

1. Set environment variables required.
    

```apache
export AR_REPO='chat-app-repo'
export SERVICE_NAME='chat-flask-app'
```

2. Next, run the following command to create the Artifact Repository:
    

```apache
gcloud artifacts repositories create "$AR_REPO" --location="$REGION" --repository-format=Docker
```

3. Configure Docker authentication and submit the container image build job to [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-push-docker-image).
    

```apache
gcloud builds submit --tag "$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME"
```

4. To verify if the image is pushed to the Artifact Registry, go to the Artifact Registry page. **Left Menu** &gt; **Artifact Registry**. Confirm the `chat-app-repo` is available.

### **Task 3. Deploy the application to Cloud Run**

Now that the application has been downloaded and built via Cloud Build, you will now deploy and test it on Cloud Run.

1. In **Cloud Shell**, run the following command:
    

```apache
gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE_NAME" --port=8080 --image="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME:latest" --allow-unauthenticated --region=$REGION --platform=managed --project=$PROJECT_ID --set-env-vars=GCP_PROJECT=$PROJECT_ID,GCP_REGION=$REGION
```

**Note:** This step will take a few minutes to complete.

2. To launch the application, click the service URL provided in the output of the last command:
    

![Service URL](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/pJIcDE8T4KD1KrCC%2F%2FNUv4le6oaT%2BX58LamVOCXtFGI%3D align="left")

3. Enter the following query into the input text box and click **Send**. You will receive a response generated by the PaLM 2 Chat Bison API in the output text box below the prompt input.

### **Task 4. Explore the python code**

To understand more about how the application utilizes the PaLM2 Chat Bison API, you will briefly explore the code used by the app.

1. In **Cloud Shell**, click **Open Editor** which will provision a new Cloud Shell Editor for you to browse the code with.
    
2. Expand the folder `chat-flask-app` and select `app.py` to begin exploring the code.

3. There are a few python methods in this file which are important to note.
    

* `create_session`: this method creates a new session with Vertex AI using the `chat-bison@001` model. It is used by the route `/palm2` which you will observe further to establish a new chat session.
    

```python
def create_session():
    chat_model = ChatModel.from_pretrained("chat-bison@001")
    chat = chat_model.start_chat()
    return chat
```

* `response`: this method defines sensible defaults for parameters used to by the PaLM2 APIs such as the `temperature`, `max_output_tokens`, `top_p` and `top_k` parameters and submits the prompt to the chat bison model using the session created by the `create_session` method to retrieve a response.
    

```python
def response(chat, message):
    parameters = {
        "temperature": 0.2,
        "max_output_tokens": 256,
        "top_p": 0.8,
        "top_k": 40
    }
    result = chat.send_message(message, **parameters)
    return result.text
```

* `index` and `vertex_palm`: the `index` and `vertex_palm` methods define routes for the application's API. The `index` method loads the `index.html` page when a user loads the application and the `vertex_palm` method submits the user's prompt collected from the `index.html` page to the API and returns the results in JSON format.
    

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    ###
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/palm2', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def vertex_palm():
    user_input = ""
    if request.method == 'GET':
        user_input = request.args.get('user_input')
    else:
        user_input = request.form['user_input']
    logger.log(f"Starting chat session...")
    chat_model = create_session()
    logger.log(f"Chat Session created")
    content = response(chat_model,user_input)
    return jsonify(content=content)
```

The `index.html` file includes inline JavaScript to read the results from the form submission when a user clicks **Send** and updates the UI with the response of the PaLM 2 API call.
