For the badges and milestones that you complete in the Facilitator program, you will earn several **"Arcade¬† + Bonus Points"** that you can **REDEEM** **for prizes and Google Cloud goodies** at the Skills Boost Arcade prize counter.

See what's the criteria of earning these points below. You can also checkout the official [Skills Boost Arcade website here](https://go.cloudskillsboost.google/arcade?utm_source=gcaf-site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=arcade-facilitator25) for more details on the points system.

Here's what you need to know about the points system:

* For each **"Game"** badge you complete, you will be awarded with **1 Arcade point**. Eg: If you complete 2 game badges, you will receive 2 points & so on. *(Note: You get 2 points for completing the monthly special Arcade game.)*
    
* For each **"Trivia"** badge you complete, you will be awarded with **1 Arcade Point**. Eg: If you complete 2 trivia badges, you will receive 2 points & so on.
    
* For every **2 "Skill Badge"** completions, you will be awarded with¬†**1 Arcade Point.**¬†Eg: If you complete 4 skill badges, you will receive 2 points & so on.
    
* On completion of any of the **milestones *(including lab-free courses)* mentioned below**, you will receive the mentioned¬†**Bonus Arcade Points**. \*(\****Note:*** *You will only receive points for the milestone that you earn and not for the ones before that.)*
    

Refer to the image on the right for a representation of these points.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** *(Read me before seeing the milestones below)*:

Earning any of the milestones below does **NOT** make you eligible for any swags/prizes. Note that, in the facilitator program, you are mainly just earning "Bonus" points that you can accumulate and add to your "Arcade" points to reach the actual Skills Boost Arcade Player achievements and thus become eligible for swags/prizes.
