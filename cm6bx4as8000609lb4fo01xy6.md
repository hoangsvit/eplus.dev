## **Overview**

While BigQuery offers built-in observability capabilities like the [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro), detailed logging remains crucial for in-depth usage analysis, auditing, and troubleshooting potential issues. Enabling [Log Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics#analytics) lets you query and analyze your log data using familiar SQL queries, then view or chart the query results.

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is Google Cloud's fully managed enterprise data warehouse that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

In this lab you will enable Log Analytics on Logs Storage buckets, then view the BigQuery logs inside Cloud Logging, and use SQL to analyze the logs using Log Analytics.

## **Objectives**

In this lab you will learn how to:

* Use Cloud Logging effectively to get insight about BigQuery usage
    
* Effectively build and run SQL queries using Log Analytics
    
* View and chart the results
    

## **Setup and Requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-915fdfaca9eb@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    gGRbHXgggVHM
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell** at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    
2. Click through the following windows:
    
    * Continue through the Cloud Shell information window.
        
    * Authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make Google Cloud API calls.
        

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-00-683ae317382f`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-00-683ae317382f
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

3. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

4. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-04-915fdfaca9eb@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

5. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-00-683ae317382f
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## **Task 1. Configure log buckets**

### Upgrade log bucket

You will configure Cloud Logging to upgrade all the existing log buckets with Log Analytics enabled.

To upgrade existing buckets to use Log Analytics:

1. From the navigation menu, select **Logging**, and then select **Logs Storage**:
    
2. Select the bucket **\_Required**.
    
3. When the **Log Analytics available** column displays **Upgrade**, you can upgrade the log bucket to use Log Analytics. Click **Upgrade**.
    
4. Click **Confirm**.
    
5. Repeat the same steps for the log bucket **\_Default**.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.

## **Task 2. Perform BigQuery Activities**

Complete the following tasks to generate some BigQuery logs. In the tasks, the BigQuery command line tool [bq](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference) is used.

1. Use the `bq mk` command to create new datasets named **bq\_logs** and **bq\_logs\_test** in your project:
    

```apache
bq mk bq_logs
bq mk bq_logs_test
```

2. Use the `bq ls` command to list the datasets:
    

```apache
bq ls
```

3. Use the `bq rm` command to delete the a dataset (select **y** when prompted):
    

```apache
bq rm bq_logs_test
```

4. Create a new table:
    

```apache
bq mk \
 --table \
 --expiration 3600 \
 --description "This is a test table" \
 bq_logs.test_table \
 id:STRING,name:STRING,address:STRING
```

You should see a success message that a new empty table named **test\_table** has been created for your dataset.

Now you'll run some queries to generate logs.

5. Run the following query in Cloud Shell:
    

```apache
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT current_date'
```

6. Copy the following command into Cloud Shell and press **Enter**:
    

```apache
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
'SELECT
 gsod2021.date,
 stations.usaf,
 stations.wban,
 stations.name,
 stations.country,
 stations.state,
 stations.lat,
 stations.lon,
 stations.elev,
 gsod2021.temp,
 gsod2021.max,
 gsod2021.min,
 gsod2021.mxpsd,
 gsod2021.gust,
 gsod2021.fog,
 gsod2021.hail
FROM
 `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2021` gsod2021
INNER JOIN
 `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` stations
ON
 gsod2021.stn = stations.usaf
 AND gsod2021.wban = stations.wban
WHERE
 stations.country = "US"
 AND gsod2021.date = "2021-12-15"
 AND stations.state IS NOT NULL
 AND gsod2021.max != 9999.9
ORDER BY
 gsod2021.min;'
```

(This query uses weather data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/noaa-datasets-on-google-cloud-for-environmental-exploration))

## **Task 3. Perform log analysis**

One common task when analyzing BigQuery usage is to search specific operations for your datasets. For each query you run, remember to replace `[Your Project Id]` with the project id provisioned for this lab.

1. In the left navigation, under Logging, click **Log Analytics** to access the feature. You should see something like the following:
    

![Log Analytics results](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/m7aMPBQ59tM3bnRpfFw95pyEZjdl2Ez964NcYmjKHk0%3D align="left")

If your query field is empty or you forget which table you want to use, you can click the **Query** button to get the sample query back.

2. To find operations such as created or deleted, run the following query:
    

```sql
SELECT
 timestamp,
 severity,
 resource.type,
 proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email,
 proto_payload.audit_log.method_name,
 proto_payload.audit_log.resource_name,
FROM
 `[Your Project Id].global._Required._AllLogs`
WHERE
 log_id = 'cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity'
 AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name LIKE 'datasetservice%'
LIMIT
 100
```

3. You should see the output like the following. You can also limit your search with more specifics such as `method_name = 'datasetservice.delete'.`
    

results for datasetservice query

![Results for datasetservice query](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/TzXMW%2BUGvQD8TnbWN6c74PM1jpaQkrRW06bg%2BxGCPjo%3D align="left")

4. To find the operations for BigQuery tables, change the query condition for table services. Run this query to find operations on tables that are created or deleted:
    

```sql
SELECT
 timestamp,
 severity,
 resource.type,
 proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email,
 proto_payload.audit_log.method_name,
 proto_payload.audit_log.resource_name,
FROM
 `[Your Project Id].global._Required._AllLogs`
WHERE
 log_id = 'cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity'
 AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name LIKE '%TableService%'
LIMIT
 100
```

You should see the output like the following:

![Results for TableService query](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/3dj2LN0cD6eioupCzHZqQaKo93xWR7eAY18m0tcdE2A%3D align="left")

5. To view completed BigQuery queries, search the `data_access` log based on the `jobCompletedEvent`. For example, run the following SQL query:
    

```sql
SELECT
 timestamp,
 resource.labels.project_id,
 proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobConfiguration.query.query) AS query,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobConfiguration.query.statementType) AS statementType,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatus.error.message) AS message,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.startTime) AS startTime,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.endTime) AS endTime,
 CAST(TIMESTAMP_DIFF( CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.endTime) AS TIMESTAMP), CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.startTime) AS TIMESTAMP), MILLISECOND)/1000 AS INT64) AS run_seconds,
 CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.totalProcessedBytes) AS INT64) AS totalProcessedBytes,
 CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.totalSlotMs) AS INT64) AS totalSlotMs,
 JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.referencedTables) AS tables_ref,
 CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.totalTablesProcessed) AS INT64) AS totalTablesProcessed,
 CAST(JSON_VALUE(proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent.job.jobStatistics.queryOutputRowCount) AS INT64) AS queryOutputRowCount,
 severity
FROM
 `[Your Project Id].global._Default._Default`
WHERE
 log_id = "cloudaudit.googleapis.com/data_access"
 AND proto_payload.audit_log.service_data.jobCompletedEvent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
 startTime
```

After the SQL query completes, you should see the output like the following:

![Results of data_access and jobCompletedEvent query](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tct%2FLEVfK0KpqK8PMz7HlCLUP0s0gJ7CALt110%2F4Ll4%3D align="left")

Since the query strings are included in the SQL query, the results might be large. Scroll through the results and look for the completed BigQuery queries.

## **Task 4. Create a chart**

Instead of using a table to see the results, Log Analytics supports creating charts for visualization.

1. Click the **Chart** button in the result view,
    
2. Select **Pie chart** as the chart type and **query** as the column.
    
3. You should see the chart similar to the following.
