The [**turnstile-laravel**](https://github.com/derekcodes-io/turnstile-laravel) package integrates [**Turnstile's**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) siteverify API with a server-side Laravel application. To use Turnstile in your Laravel application, you'll need to follow the [**getting started**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/) to set up the client-side integration. The client integration consists of a JavaScript widget that you either render implicitly or explicitly.

Once your users initiate a secured action via the browser, it'll send a request to the server side with a `cf-turnstile-response` input. This package takes care of taking the POST input sent to the server side and validating the user via the siteverify endpoint:

```php
use DerekCodes\TurnstileLaravel\TurnstileLaravel;
 
$turnstile = new TurnstileLaravel;
$response = $turnstile->validate(
    $request->get('cf-turnstile-response')
);
 
if ($response['status'] == true) {
    // Register a user
    // Complete an action
    // etc.
}
```

You could use Turnstile to provide a Captcha challenge for important application actions, such as login, registration, or any other interaction to want to ensure Captcha with a less intrusive style of challenge. The widget types do not include solving Captcha puzzles, but instead offer the following challenges for users:

* A non-interactive challenge.
    
* A non-intrusive interactive challenge (such as clicking a button), if the visitor is a suspected bot.
    
* An invisible challenge to the browser.
    

As of writing, Turnstile is an open beta and available as a free tool. Calls are limited to one million siteverify calls per month.

You can learn more about this package, get full installation instructions, and view the [**source code**](https://github.com/derekcodes-io/turnstile-laravel) on GitHub. You can learn more about Turnstile and how to set it up from Cloudflare's [**documenation**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).
