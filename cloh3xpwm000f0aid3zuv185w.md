## **Introducing Detail Dive**

Detail Dive is the new main output mode and comes with structured and expandable cards instead of the previous CLI output that is similar to the output in a terminal. It features an option to display SQL queries when they happen during the code execution and it's a great way to debug the code. Collections and arrays are collapsed by default but can be expanded to see their content, the same goes for relations that come with models.
