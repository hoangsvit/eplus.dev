## **Introducing Detail Dive**

Detail Dive is the new main output mode and comes with structured and expandable cards instead of the previous CLI output that is similar to the output in a terminal. It features an option to display SQL queries when they happen during the code execution and it's a great way to debug the code. Collections and arrays are collapsed by default but can be expanded to see their content, the same goes for relations that come with models.

### **Table Mode**

Instead of a different tinker mode, the table view is now part of the detail dive output. It's a great way to display, filter, and export data from your database.

### **Mailable Preview**

Prepare data and pass them to Mailables to preview them directly in the output without sending them. That's the easiest way to test emails.

### **Object Graph**

Inspect relations of objects within the object graph view of Tinkerwell 4. The graph displays every relation of the object and allows you to dive deeper into the data.

## **AI code generation**

Instead of writing or refactoring every line of code yourself, you can leverage the AI assistant to generate code for you. It uses the same technology as GitHub Copilot and you can add your own Open AI API key to the Tinkerwell settings to get started without any extra subscription with us.

## **Log Trailing**

Tinkerwell 4 comes with a new feature called log trailing. It allows you to see the latest log entries of your application in real time. It's a great way to debug your application and see what's happening in the background. Instead of diving into the logs in your terminal, connect to your application with Tinkerwell and search, filter, and display log entries.

## **Custom Themes**

Tinkerwell 4 has a new theme selector with preview mode and you can choose between multiple light and dark themes. You can also create your own themes and share them with the community or share your love about Tinkerwell and get access to a theme reserved for our biggest fans.

## **There's more**

We've improved many existing features and added new ones that were requested by the community.

### **Customizable Shortcuts**

Make Tinkerwell your own with custom shortcuts â€“ we've added a new shortcut editor that allows you to set the shortcuts to your preference.

### **Remote Docker Support**

Running Docker containers in production? We've got you covered with the same detection for containers that Tinkerwell has supported since version 3.

### **Reorganized Settings**

New features make new settings so we've reorganized the settings page to make them easier to find and understand.

### **Zen Mode**

The Zen Mode is a new mode for purists who mostly use shortcuts and want to hide every toolbar and sidebar to focus on the code.

### **Improved Code Completion**

The upgraded code-completing engine has better support for Laravel and uses types to detect methods and properties and can even follow relations.

### **New Theme Selector**

Selecting a theme is now easier than ever with the new theme selector that comes with a nice preview of the selected theme.

### **Background Updates**

Skip the update process and get the latest version of Tinkerwell automatically. It's by far the most requested feature over the years.
