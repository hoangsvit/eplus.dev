## Overview

In this lab you will analyze historical weather observations from NOAA using BigQuery, then use the weather data in conjunction with citizen complaints to 311 in New York City - very similar to [Reto Meier's blog post](https://medium.com/google-cloud/four-seasons-and-5-boroughs-in-one-post-d8c90afc7071) that demonstrates how data variables can correlate to each other.

You will try out several aspects of Google Cloud that are of great benefit to scientists:

1. **Serverless.** No need to download data to your machine in order to work with it - the dataset will remain on the cloud.
    
2. **Ease of use.** Run ad-hoc SQL queries on your dataset without having to prepare the data, like indexes, beforehand.
    
3. **Scale.** Carry out data exploration on extremely large datasets interactively. You don't need to sample the data in order to work with it in a timely manner.
    
4. **Shareability**. Run queries on data from different datasets without any issues. BigQuery is a convenient way to share datasets. Of course, you can also keep your data private, or share them only with specific persons -- not all data need to be public.
    

The end-result is that you will find what types of citizen complaints are correlated to weather. For example, you will find (not surprisingly) that complaints about residential furnaces are most common when it is cold outside.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you'll:

* Carry out interactive queries on the BigQuery console.
    
* Combine and run analytics on multiple datasets.
    
* Use the `CORR` function to determine positive, negative, or no correlation between datasets.
    

## Prerequisites

This is a **introductory level** lab and assumes some experience with BigQuery and SQL. If you have never worked with BigQuery or MySQL, the [BigQuery: Qwik Start - Console](https://google.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/685) lab can get you up to speed with these Google Cloud services.

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-419e21b2449e@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    MX08j5lRlmoH
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

  -- Replace numerical null values with actual null
  AVG(IF (temp=9999.9,
      null,
      temp)) AS temperature,
  AVG(IF (wdsp="999.9",
      null,
      CAST(wdsp AS Float64))) AS wind_speed,
  AVG(IF (prcp=99.99,
      0,
      prcp)) AS precipitation
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*`
WHERE
  CAST(YEAR AS INT64) > 2010
  AND CAST(MO AS INT64) = 6
  AND CAST(DA AS INT64) = 12
  AND (stn="725030" OR  -- La Guardia

## Task 3. Saving a new table of weather data

1. In the Explorer pane of the BigQuery Console, click on the **three dots** next to your `Project ID` and then select **Create dataset**.
    
2. In the Create dataset dialog, set the **Dataset ID** to `demos` and leave the other options at their default values.
    
3. Click **Create dataset**. Your project now has a dataset named `demos`.
    
4. Click **"+"** (Create SQL query) icon and then run the following query:
    

```apache
SELECT
  -- Create a timestamp from the date components.
  timestamp(concat(year,"-",mo,"-",da)) as timestamp,
  -- Replace numerical null values with actual nulls
  AVG(IF (temp=9999.9, null, temp)) AS temperature,
  AVG(IF (visib=999.9, null, visib)) AS visibility,
  AVG(IF (wdsp="999.9", null, CAST(wdsp AS Float64))) AS wind_speed,
  AVG(IF (gust=999.9, null, gust)) AS wind_gust,
  AVG(IF (prcp=99.99, null, prcp)) AS precipitation,
  AVG(IF (sndp=999.9, null, sndp)) AS snow_depth
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*`
WHERE
  CAST(YEAR AS INT64) > 2008
  AND (stn="725030" OR  -- La Guardia
       stn="744860")    -- JFK
GROUP BY timestamp
```

5. In the query EDITOR section, click **More** &gt; **Query settings**.
    
6. In the Query settings dialog, set the following fields. Leave all others at their default value.
    

`Destination:` select **Set a destination table for query results**

`Dataset:` Type **demos** and select your dataset.

`Table Id`: Type **nyc\_weather**

`Results size`: check **Allow large results (no size limit)**

7. Click **SAVE**
    
8. Click **RUN**.
    

The results are now saved in the dataset you created (demos).

9. Navigate back to **More &gt; Query settings** and, in the Destination option select **Save query results in a temporary table**. This removes the demos dataset as a destination for future queries.
    
10. Click **SAVE** to close the query settings.

## Task 4. Finding correlation between datasets

Strong correlation, as measured by the `CORR function`, indicates a close and consistent relationship between two variables. As the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also tends to increase (positive correlation) or decrease (negative correlation) in a predictable way. Strong correlation is generally considered to be a value greater than or equal to 0.7, in absolute terms. This means that the changes in one variable can explain at least 49% of the changes in the other variable.

Next you will compare the number of complaints received and daily temperature using the [CORR](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/statistical_aggregate_functions) function.

1. Create SQL query, **"+"**, and run the following query:
    

```apache
SELECT
  descriptor,
  sum(complaint_count) as total_complaint_count,
  count(temperature) as data_count,
  ROUND(corr(temperature, avg_count),3) AS corr_count,
  ROUND(corr(temperature, avg_pct_count),3) AS corr_pct
From (
SELECT
  avg(pct_count) as avg_pct_count,
  avg(day_count) as avg_count,
  sum(day_count) as complaint_count,
  descriptor,
  temperature
FROM (
  SELECT
    DATE(timestamp) AS date,
    temperature
  FROM
    demos.nyc_weather) a
  JOIN (
  SELECT x.date, descriptor, day_count, day_count / all_calls_count as pct_count
  FROM
    (SELECT
      DATE(created_date) AS date,
      concat(complaint_type, ": ", descriptor) as descriptor,
      COUNT(*) AS day_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests`
    GROUP BY
      date,
      descriptor)x
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        DATE(timestamp) AS date,
        COUNT(*) AS all_calls_count
      FROM `demos.nyc_weather`
      GROUP BY date
    )y
  ON x.date=y.date
)b
ON
  a.date = b.date
GROUP BY
  descriptor,
  temperature
)
GROUP BY descriptor
HAVING
  total_complaint_count > 5000 AND
  ABS(corr_pct) > 0.5 AND
  data_count > 5
ORDER BY
  ABS(corr_pct) DESC
```

The results indicate that Heating complaints are negatively correlated with temperature (i.e., more heating calls on cold days) and calls about dead trees are positively correlated with temperature (i.e., more calls on hot days).

Next, compare the number of complaints and wind speed with the CORR function.

2. Click **"+"** (Create SQL query) icon and run the following query:
    

```apache
SELECT
  descriptor,
  sum(complaint_count) as total_complaint_count,
  count(wind_speed) as data_count,
  ROUND(corr(wind_speed, avg_count),3) AS corr_count,
  ROUND(corr(wind_speed, avg_pct_count),3) AS corr_pct
From (
SELECT
  avg(pct_count) as avg_pct_count,
  avg(day_count) as avg_count,
  sum(day_count) as complaint_count,
  descriptor,
  wind_speed
FROM (
  SELECT
    DATE(timestamp) AS date,
    wind_speed
  FROM
    demos.nyc_weather) a
  JOIN (
  SELECT x.date, descriptor, day_count, day_count / all_calls_count as pct_count
  FROM
    (SELECT
      DATE(created_date) AS date,
      concat(complaint_type, ": ", descriptor) as descriptor,
      COUNT(*) AS day_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests`
    GROUP BY
      date,
      descriptor)x
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        DATE(timestamp) AS date,
        COUNT(*) AS all_calls_count
      FROM `demos.nyc_weather`
      GROUP BY date
    )y
  ON x.date=y.date
)b
ON
  a.date = b.date
GROUP BY
  descriptor,
  wind_speed
)
GROUP BY descriptor
HAVING
  total_complaint_count > 5000 AND
  ABS(corr_pct) > 0.5 AND
  data_count > 5
ORDER BY
  ABS(corr_pct) DESC
```

3. Notice that the Corr columns are both negative for noise related complaints â€” Do you have a hypothesis for why noise complaints reduce on windy days? Are the coefficients statistically sufficient?
