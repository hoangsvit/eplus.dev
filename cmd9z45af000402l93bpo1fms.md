## Overview

Google Workspace by Google Cloud is your go-to solution for productivity tools. Get more done with seamless collaboration tools, a simple management interface, and enterprise-level security and reliability. Easily add users, manage devices, and configure security and settings so your data stays safe.

Centralized administration makes set up and management fast and easy. But access to Google Workspace Administration controls is not commonly available for practice, so in this lab you are provided with an organization "Google Workspace Labs" and a temporary Google Workspace domain to work in.

In this lab, you personalize your Google Workspace Admin console to suit your needs, and then make some basic modifications to the Admin Console, and modify the company profile. Then you provision users both individually and in a batch upload using a CSV file.

### Objectives

In this lab, learn how to do the following through the Google Workspace Admin Console:

* Change your organization's name
    
* Enter the correct primary and secondary administrator emails
    
* Select a default time zone for new users
    
* Select new user feature release schedule
    
* Select communication preferences for your domain
    
* Add your company's logo
    
* Add users individually and bulk uploading with a CSV file
    
* Log in as an added user to verify the customization
    

### Prerequisites

To get the most from this lab, familiarity with basic Google Workspace terminology is recommended.

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Start your lab

When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left.

### Sign in to the Google Workspace Admin Console

To access the Google Workspace Admin Console, you must find your credentials and then sign in.

#### Find your lab's User Email and Password

To access the resources and console for this lab, locate the **User Email** and **Password** in the Lab Details panel. This panel is on the left or at the top, depending on the width of the browser window. Use these credentials to log in to the Google Workspace Admin Console.

If your lab requires other resource identifiers or connection-related information, they appear on this panel as well.

#### Sign in to the Admin Console

1. Click **Open Google Workspace Admin Console**.
    

***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

**Note:** If you see the **Verify your account** dialog:

* Click **Next**.
    
* Click the prefilled user.
    
* Click **Use another account**.
    

2. On the Sign in page, log in using the **User Email** and **Password** details provided.
    
3. When prompted, click **I understand** and **ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICE** to accept all terms and conditions.
    

After a few seconds, the *Admin Console* opens.

4. Right-click **VERIFY DOMAIN** in either the yellow box at the top or the red box in the *Domains* card, and select **Open link in new tab**.
    
    **Note:** To complete this step in a real-life scenario, you'd need to add an actual DNS record.
    
5. Click the new tab, called **Domain setup**, to complete the Google Workspace domain verification steps.
    
6. On the *Let's set up your domain* page, click **Get Started**.
    
7. Select the **My domain uses a different host** checkbox and then click **Continue**.
    
8. At the bottom of the *Add verification code* page, select the **Come back here and confirm once you have updated the code on your domain host** checkbox, and then click **Confirm**.
    
9. Wait until it says **Your domain is verified!** and then close the *Domain setup* tab.
    
    **Note:** Do not click **Activate Gmail**.
    
10. Return to the **Admin Console** tab and refresh the page.

6. In the **Support message** section, enter a message users will see if they can't sign in to their Google Workspace account. This message usually identifies who to contact or instructions if they forget their password, for example "Contact Magda Smith for any Sign In issues." Click **Save**.
    
7. Specify the **Language** users see for your Google services when they first sign into their managed Google account.
    
8. In the **Time zone** section, choose the default time zone that applies to your organization. Click **Save**.

* Learn more about Schedule releases from the [Choose when users get new features page](https://support.google.com/a/answer/172177/).
    

3. In **New products** select **Turned off when released**, which means that you or another administrator must manually add new products before users can access them.
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
5. Scroll down and click on **Communication preferences**.
    
6. Select all of the options and then click **Save** to save all changes.
    
7. Collapse the **Preferences** card by clicking the up-arrow at the top right of the card.
    

### Add your organization's logo

Learn more about addition instruction from the [Update user profiles or photos page](https://support.google.com/a/topic/14588) for additional instructions.

## Task 3. Batch add users from a CSV spreadsheet

1. Return to the Users page.
    
2. Click **Bulk update users**.
    
3. Click **Download blank CSV template**. This provides a blank CSV file to populate with a set of multiple users. Do not close this dialog box.
    
4. Open the CSV file in a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
    
5. Add two or more new users. The following information is required:
    

* First Name
    
* Last Name
    
* Email Address - for this lab you must use the same domain (@xxx.com) as the **User Email** for this lab.
    
    For example, if the **User Email** you used to start the lab is `student@goog-test.reseller.gappslabs.co.s-4aknhohx.qwiklabs-gsuite.net`, the email for one of the users on the spreadsheet will be `username@goog-test.reseller.gappslabs.co.s-4aknhohx.qwiklabs-gsuite.net`.
    
* Password - must meet [format guidelines](https://support.google.com/a/answer/40057?hl=en#columnref), the default requirement is 8 characters. For example, "12345678".
    
* Org Unit Path - for this lab use a backslash (/).
    

6. (Optional) Fill in the other columns.
    

**Note:** To add multiple phone numbers or addresses for a user, add columns to the spreadsheet. Rename the header accordingly. For example, to add a second home address, create a new column with the header Home Address 2.

7. Save the updated file as a CSV file on your computer.
    
8. Select the CSV file to upload:
    

* Click **Attach CSV file**.
    
* Select the CSV file and click **Open**.
    

9. Click **Upload** to import the user list. You can view progress by clicking the Tasks icon on the top right of the Users page. If there's an error, update the information as needed in your spreadsheet and upload the file again.
    

Learn more about errors from the [Add or update multiple users from a CSV file page](https://support.google.com/a/answer/40057?hl=en#common_errors).

10. After a moment, refresh your browser to reload the user list. The new users should appear.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.
