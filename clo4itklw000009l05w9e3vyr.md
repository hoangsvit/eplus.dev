**Tinkerwell** is a tool that facilitates running PHP code without the need for complex web servers or local development setups. It is particularly useful for teaching and learning PHP and its ecosystem. **Tinkerwell** offers free individual licenses for students and teachers who are part of accredited educational programs or institutions. Here's how you can obtain these licenses:

**For Students:**

1. If you are enrolled in an accredited educational program, you can apply for a free individual license.
    
2. To access the license, follow these steps:  
    \- Create or log into your account on the Beyond Code website at [beyondcode.com](http://beyondcode.com).  
    \- Go to your profile page on [beyondcode.com/profile](http://beyondcode.com/profile).  
    \- Verify your official educational email address.  
    \- A license will be automatically added to your account.
    
3. Keep in mind that you'll need to re-verify your status as a student annually to maintain an active license.
    

**For Teachers:**

1. If you are a teacher at an accredited educational institution and want to use Tinkerwell in your classroom, you can request a classroom license.
    
2. Classroom licenses are managed through a single Beyond Code account, issued to accredited educational institutions, valid for one year (renewable upon request), and must only be used for teaching purposes.
    
3. Classroom licenses are not provided for individual use or for commercial purposes.
