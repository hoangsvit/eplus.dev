1. **Which tool helps you visualize, monitor, and debug your app's workers?**  
    \[ \] Profiler  
    \[x\] Background Task Inspector  
    \[ \] LogcatDevice  
    \[ \] Manager
    
    <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>answers</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">The tool that helps you visualize, monitor, and debug your app's workers is <strong>Background Task Inspector</strong>.</div></details>
    
    Profiler and Logcat are tools that help you debug your app's code, but they do not specifically help you with workers. Device Manager is a tool that helps you manage your devices, but it does not specifically help you with workers.
    
    Background Task Inspector is a tool that is specifically designed to help you with workers. It allows you to see a visual representation of your app's workers, and it provides information about the state of each worker. This information can help you to debug problems with your workers, and it can also help you to optimize the performance of your workers.
    
    Here are some of the features of Background Task Inspector:
    
    * You can see a visual representation of your app's workers.
        
    * You can see the state of each worker.
        
    * You can see the logs for each worker.
        
    * You can cancel workers.
        
    * You can reschedule workers.
        
    
    Background Task Inspector is a powerful tool that can help you to visualize, monitor, and debug your app's workers. If you are having problems with your workers, I recommend that you use Background Task Inspector to troubleshoot the issue.
