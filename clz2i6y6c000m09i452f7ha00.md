## **Overview**

Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to create a storage bucket, upload objects to it, create folders and subfolders in it, and make objects publicly accessible using the Google Cloud command line.

Throughout this lab you'll be able to verify your work in the console by going to **Navigation menu** &gt; **Cloud Storage**. You'll just need to refresh your browser after each command is run to see the new items you've created.

### What you'll do

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use Google Cloud command line to:

* Create a storage bucket
    
* Upload objects to the bucket
    
* Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
    
* Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible
    

## **Task 1. Create a bucket**

The Cloud Storage utility tool, [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil), is installed and ready to use in Google Cloud. In this lab you use `gsutil` in Cloud Shell.

When you create a bucket you must follow the universal bucket naming rules, below.

**Bucket naming rules**

* Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
    
* Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (\_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require [verification](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification).
    
* Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
    
* Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
    
* Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
    
* Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
    
* Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".
    
* Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (\_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.
    

Use the make bucket (`mb`) command to make a bucket, replacing `<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>` with a unique name that follows the bucket naming rules:

```powershell
gsutil mb gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>
```

This command is creating a bucket with default settings. To see what those default settings are, use the Cloud console **Navigation menu** &gt; **Cloud Storage**, then click on your bucket name, and click on the **Configuration** tab.

That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

**Note:** If the bucket name is already taken, either by you or someone else, the command returns:

`Creating gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/...`  
`ServiceException: 409 Bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME already exists.`

Try again with a different bucket name.

### Test your understanding

Below is a multiple choice question to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer it to the best of your ability.

Each bucket has a default storage class, which you can specify when you create your bucket.TrueFalse

## **Task 2. Upload an object into your bucket**

Use Cloud Shell to upload an object into a bucket.

1. To download this image (ada.jpg) into your bucket, enter this command into Cloud Shell:
    

```powershell
curl https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/800px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg --output ada.jpg
```

2. Use the `gsutil cp` command to upload the image from the location where you saved it to the bucket you created:
    

```powershell
gsutil cp ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
```

**Note:** When typing your bucket name, you can use the tab key to autocomplete it.

You can see the image load into your bucket from the command line.

You've just stored an object in your bucket!

3. Now remove the downloaded image:
    

```powershell
rm ada.jpg
```

## **Task 3. Download an object from your bucket**

* Use the `gsutil cp` command to download the image you stored in your bucket to Cloud Shell:
    

```powershell
gsutil cp -r gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg .
```

If successful, the command returns:

```powershell
Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg...
/ [1 files][360.1 KiB/2360.1 KiB]
Operation completed over 1 objects/360.1 KiB.
```

You've just downloaded the image from your bucket.

## **Task 4. Copy an object to a folder in the bucket**

* Use the `gsutil cp` command to create a folder called `image-folder` and copy the image (ada.jpg) into it:
    

```powershell
gsutil cp gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/
```

**Note:** Compared to local file systems, [folders in Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/HowSubdirectoriesWork) have limitations, but many of the same operations are supported.

If successful, the command returns:

```powershell
Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg [Content-Type=image/png]...
- [1 files] [ 360.1 KiB/ 360.1 KiB]
Operation completed over 1 objects/360.1 KiB
```

The image file has been copied into a new folder in your bucket.

### Test completed task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have successfully uploaded an object into a folder in your Cloud Storage bucket, you'll see an assessment score.

Copy an object to a folder in the bucket (ada.jpg).

**Check my progress**

## **Task 5. List contents of a bucket or folder**

* Use the `gsutil ls` command to list the contents of the bucket:
    

```powershell
gsutil ls gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
```

If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

```powershell
gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/
```

That's everything currently in your bucket.

## **Task 6. List details for an object**

* Use the `gsutil ls` command, with the `-l` flag to get some details about the image file you uploaded to your bucket:
    

```powershell
gsutil ls -l gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
```

If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

```powershell
306768  2017-12-26T16:07:570Z  gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
TOTAL: 1 objects, 30678 bytes (360.1 KiB)
```

Now you know the image's size and date of creation.

## **Task 7. Make your object publicly accessible**

* Use the `gsutil acl ch` command to grant all users read permission for the object stored in your bucket:
    

```powershell
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
```

If successful, the command returns:

```powershell
Updated ACL on gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
```

Your image is now public, and can be made available to anyone.

**Note:** Who are you looking at? This is [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), credited with being the first computer programmer. She worked with mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage, who proposed the [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).

Her interest in the Analytical Engine lead to translating a paper on the machine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, adding her own extensive annotations. These notes are considered the first computer program - an algorithm designed to be carried out by the machine. She developed a vision of the capability of computers, going beyond number crunching, and examined how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.

### Test your understanding

Below is a multiple choice question to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer it to the best of your ability.

An access control list (ACL) is a mechanism you can use to define who has access to your buckets and objects.TrueFalse

## **Task 8. Remove public access**

1. To remove this permission, use the command:
    

```powershell
gsutil acl ch -d AllUsers gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
```

If successful, the command returns:

```powershell
Updated ACL on gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
```

You have removed public access to this object.

2. Verify that you've removed public access by clicking the **Refresh** button in the console. The checkmark will be removed.
