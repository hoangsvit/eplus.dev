## **Overview**

[Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio/) turns your data into informative dashboards and reports that are easy to read, easy to share, and fully customizable. Dashboarding allows you to tell great data stories to support better business decisions.

[BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

The dataset used in this lab is an ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the [Google Merchandise Store](https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/) loaded into BigQuery. You will explore the available fields and rows of the dataset for insights.

This lab focuses on how to create new reports and explore your ecommerce dataset visually for insights.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Launch Looker Studio
    
* Create and customize a report
    
* Create an interactive filter for your report
    

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

## **Task 1. Launch Looker Studio and create a blank report**

1. Open [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) in a new browser tab or window.
    

**Note:** Make sure that you are logged in using the username and password provided in the Connection Details panel.

The Looker Studio home page opens.

    * On the Sign up for emails to get the most out of Looker Studio dialog, select "No" to all options, then click **Continue**.
        
4. Click the **Blank report** template again.
    

A new, untitled report opens.

5. You'll be on the **Connect to data** tab.
