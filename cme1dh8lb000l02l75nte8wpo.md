## Overview

Google has a planet-scale, advanced, fiber-optic software-defined network with presence in over 200 countries and territories. This network provides services such as Search, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud and more to billions of users and customers.

There are six Google Cloud building blocks of cloud networking. By grouping the network functions into six building blocks (Network connectivity, Network security, Service Networking, Service security, Content delivery, Observability) we can conceptualize the Google Cloud networking services that help us achieve the requirements we are trying to address.

If you are new to cloud computing or looking for an overview of Google Cloud networking, you are in the right place. Read on to learn about the specifics of this lab and additional next steps to get hands-on practice.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you will learn about the following:

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
    
* Network services
    
* Network connectivity
    
* Networking security
    
* Network Observability
    
* Network Service Tiers
    
* Cross-Cloud Network
    

## Lab fundamentals

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Understanding Regions and Zones

Certain Compute Engine resources live in regions or zones. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more zones. For example, the us-central1 region denotes a region in the Central United States that has zones `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c`, and `us-central1-f`.

| **Regions** | **Zones** |
| --- | --- |
| Western US | us-west1-a, us-west1-b |
| Central US | us-central1-a, us-central1-b, us-central1-d, us-central1-f |
| Eastern US | us-east1-b, us-east1-c, us-east1-d |
| Western Europe | europe-west1-b, europe-west1-c, europe-west1-d |
| Eastern Asia | asia-east1-a, asia-east1-b, asia-east1-c |

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

Learn more about regions and zones and see a complete list in the Compute Engine page, [Regions and zones documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/)).

## Task 1. Networking Overview

Google Cloud networking is a comprehensive suite of networking services to enable businesses to build, scale, and manage secure and scalable network infrastructure in Google Cloud.

Google's global network also supports AI workloads for both managed and Do it Yourself options, with advanced capabilities such as protective reroute and specialized datacenters networking with support for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). The Google Cloud network is continually evolving and the diagram below shows a visual representation of the [network scale](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations)

* ![Google Cloud Network](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/Sn90BF%2F%2Blq918i9TEhYQMxEjVk14wktypTtmqY0hekQ%3D align="left")
    

**The network consists of:**

* [Region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#identifying_a_region_or_zone) - Geographical location.
    
* [Zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#identifying_a_region_or_zone) - Interconnected deployment centers within a region. Currently a region comprises a minimum of three zones.
    
* [Point of presence](https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure) (PoP) - Connects public internet to Google Cloud. Provides services like Cloud CDN, Media CDN, and Cloud Interconnect.
    

Google Cloud provides a wide range of products and services that address all aspects of networking, from basic connectivity to advanced traffic management and security.

**To learn more about Google's global network flexibility and scalability, take 3 minutes to view the following video.**

Over the course of this lab, you will learn what some of these products provide and how they can be integrated into your solution.

## Task 2. Understand Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Google Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a foundational component of Google Cloud's networking infrastructure. It allows you to create a logically isolated virtual network within the Google Cloud, providing a private and secure environment for your cloud resources. You can define your own IP address space, subnetworks, and routing policies, giving you complete control over your network connectivity.

**To learn more about Virtual Private Cloud, take a minute to view the following video.**

**Key features of Google Cloud's VPC:**

* **Private IP address space**: Define your own private IP address range, ensuring no overlap with other networks.
    
* **Subnetwork**: Divide your VPC into multiple subnets to organize and segment your network resources.
    
* **Customizable routing**: Control how traffic flows within your VPC and between VPCs.
    
* **Firewall rules**: Define firewall rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, enhancing network security.
    

**Example use cases of Google Cloud's VPC:**

* **Hosting web applications and services**: Create a VPC to isolate your web applications from other resources and the public internet, enhancing security and performance.
    
* **Deploying microservices-based architectures**: Utilize VPCs to segment microservices and manage traffic flow between them, enabling scalability and flexibility.
    
* **Connecting on-premises networks**: Establish secure connections between your on-premises network and Google Cloud resources via Cloud VPN, or Cloud Interconnect enabling hybrid cloud deployments.
    
* **Creating a secure cloud environment for sensitive data**: Leverage VPCs to isolate and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring data privacy and compliance.
    
* **Running AI workloads:** VPCs with [network profiles](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/network-profiles) allow you to utilize RDMA over converger ethernet for [high performance GPU VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines#a4x-vms) like the A3 ultra, A4 and A4X. This RDMA profile creates an isolated VPC used specifically for GPU to GPU communication between nodes.
    

Google Cloud's VPC provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building and managing secure, scalable, and performant network infrastructure in the cloud.
