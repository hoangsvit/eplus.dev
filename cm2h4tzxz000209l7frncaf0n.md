1. **In this quiz, you will practice applying the Triple Constraint (budget, time, scope) to the following project scenario:** 
    
    Imagine you are a User Experience (UX) Program Manager at a small design agency. You are asked to manage an 8-week project for $800,000 USD. The project includes conducting field research and synthesizing results. As the final deliverable, your agency will create a research report and facilitate a 3-day workshop. You need to align with the client’s Vice President (VP) of Design, Ria. Luckily, you have a team of five teammates to work on this project together!
    
    For the three situations below, describe how you would apply the Triple Constraint model. Provide examples to help illustrate your explanations. Are you ready?
    
    * <mark>I’m ready!</mark>
        
2. **During the scoping of this project, Ria says her budget maxes out at $650,000 USD*—*she can’t afford the $800,000 USD that this project will cost. What are some proposals you can provide to Ria to reduce the budget? Think of the Triple Constraint and remember that one constraint will always have the priority. So if the budget is a constraint, what areas might Ria adjust to reduce project costs? Write 2-3 sentences.**
    
    Your answer cannot be more than 10000 characters.
    
    ```plaintext
    To help Ria reduce the project budget, you could propose adjusting the project’s **scope** or **schedule**. By revisiting the scope, you could identify features or components that could be eliminated or simplified to lower costs. Additionally, extending the project timeline may allow for a more phased approach, enabling the team to allocate resources more efficiently and potentially take advantage of cost-saving measures over time. Prioritizing these adjustments can help align the project with Ria’s budget constraints while still delivering valuable outcomes.
    ```
    
3. **Recruiting for field research will take a week longer than expected. However, Ria told you that the project end date is a hard deadline. What can you do? Think of the triple constraint and remember that one of them will always have the priority. So if time is a constraint, what areas might Ria adjust to reduce the time in the project? Write 2-3 sentences.**
    
    Your answer cannot be more than 10000 characters.
    
    ```plaintext
    Since the project end date is a hard deadline, you can propose adjusting the **scope** or the **resources** to accommodate the longer recruitment time. One option is to prioritize essential research activities and eliminate or postpone non-critical tasks to ensure the key deliverables are still met on time. Additionally, consider increasing the project team or utilizing additional resources to expedite the recruitment process and compensate for the delay, thereby helping to meet the deadline without sacrificing quality.
    ```
    
4. **After the stakeholders agree on the project scope, Ria finds out that her CEO wants more information in the research report. She asks you to include details on the market opportunities for new product ideas, technical constraints, and design considerations. How do you manage this additional scope? Write 2-3 sentences.**
    
    Your answer cannot be more than 10000 characters.
    
    ```plaintext
    To manage the additional scope requested by Ria's CEO, it’s important to initiate a scope change process. First, evaluate the impact of these new requirements on the project's timeline, resources, and budget, then communicate these implications to Ria and the stakeholders. After obtaining their approval for the adjustments, update the project plan to incorporate the new elements while ensuring that essential deliverables remain on track.
    ```
    
5. **As a reminder, if there are changes in time, budget, and scope, remember to notify your project sponsor and key stakeholder and make sure they’re aligned. In this specific example, you should notify the internal stakeholders, so that they can make decisions about what to do about the changes in the project, while considering the Triple Constraint.**
