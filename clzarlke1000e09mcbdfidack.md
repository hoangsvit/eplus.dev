### **Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business**

1. **An organization has made significant investments in their own infrastructure and has regulatory requirements for their data to be hosted on-premises. Which cloud implementation would best suit their needs?**
    
    * Software as a service
        
    * Platform as a service
        
    * <mark>Private Cloud</mark>
        
    * Public Cloud
        
2. **As the world and business changes, organizations have to decide between embracing new technology and transforming, or keeping their technology and approaches the same. What risks might an organization face by not transforming as their market evolves?**
    
    * <mark>Focusing on ‘how’ they operate can prevent organizations from seeing transformation opportunities.</mark>
        
    * Organizations risk losing market leadership if they spend too much time on digital transformation.
        
    * Focusing on ‘why’ they operate can lead to inefficient use of resources and disruption.
        
    * Embracing new technology can cause organizations to overspend on innovation.
        
3. **What is the benefit of implementing a transformation cloud that is based on open infrastructure?**
    
    * On-premises software isn't open source, so cloud applications are more portable.
        
    * <mark>Open source software reduces the chance of vendor lock-in.</mark>
        
    * Open standards make it easier to hire more developers.
        
    * Open source software makes it easier to patent proprietary software.
        
4. **An organization has a new application, and user subscriptions are growing faster than on-premises infrastructure can handle. What benefit of the cloud might help them in this situation?**
    
    * It's secure, so the organization won't have to worry about the new subscribers data.
        
    * <mark>It's scalable, so the organization could shorten their infrastructure deployment time.</mark>
        
    * It's cost effective, so the organization will no longer have to pay for computing once the app is in the cloud.
        
    * It provides physical access, so the organization can deploy servers faster.
        
5. **Which item describes a goal of an organization seeking digital transformation?**
    
    * <mark>Break down data silos and generate real time insights.</mark>
        
    * Reduce emissions by using faster networks in their on-premises workloads.
        
    * Ensure better security by decoupling teams and their data.
        
    * Streamline their hardware procurement process to forecast at least a quarter into the future.
        
6. **What is the cloud?**
    
    * A Google product made up of on-premises IT infrastructure.
        
    * A Google product for computing large amounts of data.
        
    * <mark>A metaphor for a network of data centers.</mark>
        
    * A metaphor for the networking capability of internet providers.
        
7. **Select the definition of digital transformation.**
    
    * <mark>When an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences.</mark>
        
    * When an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify technology infrastructure to focus on cost saving.
        
    * When an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify financial models for how a business is run.
        
    * When an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify on-premises business processes.
        
8. What is seen as a limitation of on-premises infrastructure, when compared to cloud infrastructure?
    
    * <mark>The on-premises hardware procurement process can take a long time.</mark>
        
    * Scaling processing is too difficult due to power consumption.
        
    * The on-premises networking is more complicated.
        
    * Maintenance workers do not have physical access to the servers.
        
9. **Select the two capabilities that form the basis of a transformation cloud? Select two correct answers.**
    
    * <mark>Open infrastructure gives the freedom to innovate by running applications in the place that makes the most sense.</mark>
        
    * A trusted cloud gives control of all resources to the user to ensure high availability at all times.
        
    * <mark>Data cloud provides a unified solution to manage data across the entire data lifecycle.</mark>
        
    * Sustainable cloud ensures the costs of cloud resources are controlled to prevent budget overrun.
        

### **Fundamental Cloud Concepts**

1. **Which network performance metric describes the amount of data a network can transfer in a given amount of time?**
    
    * <mark>Bandwidth</mark>
        
    * Fiber optics
        
    * Latency
        
    * Domain Name System (DNS)
        
2. **An organization wants to innovate using the latest technologies, but also has compliance needs that specify data must be stored in specific locations. Which cloud approach would best suit their needs?**
    
    * On-premises infrastructure
        
    * <mark>Hybrid Cloud</mark>
        
    * Multicloud
        
    * Public Cloud
        
3. **An organization wants to ensure they have redundancy of their resources so their application remains available in the event of a disaster. How can they ensure this happens?**
    
    * By putting resources in the Domain Name System (DNS).
        
    * Using the edge network to cache the whole application image in a backup.
        
    * By assigning a different IP address to each resource.

    * Software as a Service (SaaS)
        
    * <mark>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</mark>
        
    * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        
    * Function as a Service (FaaS)
        
2. **In the cloud computing shared responsibility model, what types of content are customers always responsible for, regardless of the computing model chosen?**
    
    * The customer is responsible for security of the operating system, software stack required to run their applications and any hardware, networks, and physical security.
        
    * The customer is responsible for securing anything that they create within the cloud, such as the configurations, access policies, and user data.
        
    * The customer is responsible for all infrastructure decisions, server configurations and database monitoring.
        
    * <mark>The customer is not responsible for any of the data in the cloud, as data management is the responsibility of the cloud provider who is hosting the data.</mark>
        
3. **An organization wants to move their collaboration software to the cloud, but due to limited IT staff one of their main drivers is having low maintenance needs. Which cloud computing model would best suit their requirements?**
    
    * Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        
    * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        
    * IT as a service (ITaaS)
        
    * <mark>Software as a Service (SaaS)</mark>
        
4. **Which option best describes a benefit of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?**
    
    * <mark>It’s efficient, as IaaS resources are available when needed and resources aren’t wasted by overbuilding capacity.</mark>
        
    * It has low management overhead, as all administration and management tasks for data, servers, storage, and updates are handled by the cloud vendor.
        
    * It reduces development time, as developers can go straight to coding instead of spending time setting up and maintaining a development environment.
        
    * It's cost-effective, as all infrastructure costs are handled under a single monthly or annual subscription fee.
