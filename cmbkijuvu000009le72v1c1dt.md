## Overview

Gmail is an email service developed by Google. Gmail stores your email safely in the cloud, allowing you to access it from any computer or device with a web browser. You can also quickly organize and find important email, as well as read and draft email without an internet connection.

### What you'll do

In this lab you:

* Create and send email
    
* Manage your inbox
    
* Create signatures
    
* Access your calendar, notes, and tasks
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long lab resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Gmail for the duration of the lab.

### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    
* Time to complete the lab.
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This avoids conflicts between your personal account and the student account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to Gmail

1. When ready, click **Start Lab**.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use to sign into Gmail for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
2. Click **Open Gmail**.
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-913c0f0f9a87@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    TAj2dp3y5nyO
    ```
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
7. If needed, click **I understand** to accept the terms.
    
    Gmail opens.
    
8. Click **Get started**, and then close any further information windows.
    

You are now in Gmail, looking at your Inbox.
