Also, they do not want to spend too much of the employees’ time, which might affect the core business. The team you have formed is excited about the project but currently lacks the skills needed for the pilot. How can you best garner the expertise needed for the machine learning project?**

* **<mark>Up-skill your current team using online learning platforms.</mark>**
    
* Borrow the sole IT analyst from another department in the business.

* **<mark>Design systems that will produce more data next year, so that your ML models can improve over time.</mark>**
    
* Run your ML models on a reduced set of data, collecting too much data risks having unnecessary storage costs and overheads.
    
* Run your ML models on data collected in batches, this ensures the value gained is spread out proportionally over time.
    
* Design systems that keep data separate from each other, these siloes avoid contaminating the data.
