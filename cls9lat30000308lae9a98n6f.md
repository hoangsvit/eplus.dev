Laravel Reverb is a new first-party WebSocket server for Laravel applications, bringing real-time communication between client and server. Some of the features of Reverb include:

## **Blazing Fast**

Reverb is fine-tuned for speed. A single server can support thousands of connections and piping data without the delay and inefficiency of HTTP polling.

## **Seamless Integration**

Develop with Laravel's broadcasting capabilities. Deploy with Reverb's first-party **Laravel Forge integration**. Monitor with baked-in support for Pulse.

## **Built for Scale**

Infinitely increase capacity by utilizing Reverb's built-in support for horizontal scaling using Redis, allowing you to manage connections and channels across multiple servers.

## **Pusher**

Reverb utilizes the Pusher protocol for WebSockets, making it immediately compatible with Laravel Broadcasting and Laravel Echo.
