## **Overview**

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. With Docker, you can separate your applications from your infrastructure and treat your infrastructure like a managed application. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.

Docker does this by combining kernel containerization features with workflows and tooling that helps you manage and deploy your applications.

Docker containers can be directly used in Kubernetes, which allows them to be run in the Kubernetes Engine with ease. After learning the essentials of Docker, you will have the skillset to start developing Kubernetes and containerized applications.

## **Objectives**

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Build, run, and debug Docker containers.
    
* Pull Docker images from Docker Hub and Google Artifact Registry.
    
* Push Docker images to Google Artifact Registry.
    

### Prerequisites

This is an **introductory level** lab. Little to no prior experience with Docker and containers is assumed. Familiarity with Cloud Shell and the command line is suggested, but not required.

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the **Lab Details** panel with the following:
    
    * The **Open Google Cloud console** button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Sign in** page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-03-bab5750f16b3@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the **Username** in the **Lab Details** panel.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    uBlrXRvfsQKL
    ```
    
    You can also find the **Password** in the **Lab Details** panel.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To view a menu with a list of Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** at the top-left.

![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/nUxFb6oRFr435O3t6V7WYJAjeDFcrFb16G9wHWp5BzU%3D align="left")

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell**
    
    ![Activate Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ep8HmqYGdD%2FkUncAAYpV47OYoHwC8%2Bg0WK%2F8sidHquE%3D align="left")
    
    at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    

When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your **Project\_ID**, `qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297`. The output contains a line that declares the **Project\_ID** for this session:

```apache
Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297
```

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

2. (Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud auth list
```

3. Click **Authorize**.
    

**Output:**

```apache
ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: student-03-bab5750f16b3@qwiklabs.net

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
```

4. (Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
    

```apache
gcloud config list project
```

**Output:**

```apache
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297
```

**Note:** For full documentation of `gcloud`, in Google Cloud, refer to [the gcloud CLI overview guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## **Task 1. Hello world**

1. In Cloud Shell enter the following command to run a hello world container to get started:
    

```apache
docker run hello-world
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
9db2ca6ccae0: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:4b8ff392a12ed9ea17784bd3c9a8b1fa3299cac44aca35a85c90c5e3c7afacdc
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

This simple container returns `Hello from Docker!` to your screen. While the command is simple, notice in the output the number of steps it performed. The Docker daemon searched for the hello-world image, didn't find the image locally, pulled the image from a public registry called Docker Hub, created a container from that image, and ran the container for you.

2. Run the following command to take a look at the container image it pulled from Docker Hub:
    

```apache
docker images
```

(Command Output)

```apache
REPOSITORY     TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
hello-world   latest    feb5d9fea6a5   14 months ago   13.3kB
```

This is the image pulled from the Docker Hub public registry. The Image ID is in [SHA256 hash](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html) formatâ€”this field specifies the Docker image that's been provisioned. When the Docker daemon can't find an image locally, it will by default search the public registry for the image.

3. Run the container again:
    

```apache
docker run hello-world
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
...
```

Notice the second time you run this, the Docker daemon finds the image in your local registry and runs the container from that image. It doesn't have to pull the image from Docker Hub.

4. Finally, look at the running containers by running the following command:
    

```apache
docker ps
```

(Command Output)

```apache
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

There are no running containers. You already exited the hello-world containers you previously ran.

5. In order to see all containers, including ones that have finished executing, run `docker ps -a`:
    

```apache
docker ps -a
```

(Command Output)

```apache
CONTAINER ID      IMAGE           COMMAND      ...     NAMES
6027ecba1c39      hello-world     "/hello"     ...     elated_knuth
358d709b8341      hello-world     "/hello"     ...     epic_lewin
```

This shows you the `Container ID`, a UUID generated by Docker to identify the container, and more metadata about the run. The container `Names` are also randomly generated but can be specified with `docker run --name [container-name] hello-world`.

## **Task 2. Build**

In this section, you will build a Docker image that's based on a simple node application.

1. Execute the following command to create and switch into a folder named `test`.
    

```apache
mkdir test && cd test
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile`:
    

```apache
cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
# Use an official Node runtime as the parent image
FROM node:lts

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Make the container's port 80 available to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.js using node when the container launches
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
EOF
```

This file instructs the Docker daemon on how to build your image.

* The initial line specifies the base parent image, which in this case is the official Docker image for node version long term support (lts).
    
* In the second, you set the working (current) directory of the container.
    
* In the third, you add the current directory's contents (indicated by the `"."` ) into the container.
    
* Then expose the container's port so it can accept connections on that port and finally run the node command to start the application.
    

**Note:** Spend some time reviewing the [Dockerfile command references](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#known-issues-run) to understand each line of the `Dockerfile`.

Now you'll write the node application, and after that you'll build the image.

3. Run the following to create the node application:
    

```apache
cat > app.js << EOF;
const http = require("http");

const hostname = "0.0.0.0";
const port = 80;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	res.statusCode = 200;
	res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
	res.end("Hello World\n");
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
	console.log("Server running at http://%s:%s/", hostname, port);
});

process.on("SIGINT", function () {
	console.log("Caught interrupt signal and will exit");
	process.exit();
});
EOF
```

This is a simple HTTP server that listens on port 80 and returns "Hello World".

Now build the image.

4. Note again the `"."`, which means current directory so you need to run this command from within the directory that has the Dockerfile:
    

```apache
docker build -t node-app:0.1 .
```

It might take a couple of minutes for this command to finish executing. When it does, your output should resemble the following:

```apache
+] Building 0.7s (8/8) FINISHED                                                                                                                                              docker:default
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                                                                                                       0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                                                                                                                                                         0.0s
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                                                                                    0.0s
 => => transferring dockerfile: 397B                                                                                                                                                    0.0s
 => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:lts
```

The `-t` is to name and tag an image with the `name:tag` syntax. The name of the image is `node-app` and the `tag` is `0.1`. The tag is highly recommended when building Docker images. If you don't specify a tag, the tag will default to `latest` and it becomes more difficult to distinguish newer images from older ones. Also notice how each line in the `Dockerfile` above results in intermediate container layers as the image is built.

5. Now, run the following command to look at the images you built:
    

```apache
docker images
```

Your output should resemble the following:

```apache
REPOSITORY     TAG      IMAGE ID        CREATED            SIZE
node-app       0.1      f166cd2a9f10    25 seconds ago     656.2 MB
node           lts      5a767079e3df    15 hours ago       656.2 MB
hello-world    latest   1815c82652c0    6 days ago         1.84 kB
```

Notice `node` is the base image and `node-app` is the image you built. You can't remove `node` without removing `node-app` first. The size of the image is relatively small compared to VMs. Other versions of the node image such as `node:slim` and `node:alpine` can give you even smaller images for easier portability. The topic of slimming down container sizes is further explored in Advanced Topics. You can view all versions in the official repository [in node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node).

## **Task 3. Run**

1. Use this code to run containers based on the image you built:
    

```apache
docker run -p 4000:80 --name my-app node-app:0.1
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/
```

The `--name` flag allows you to name the container if you like. The `-p` instructs Docker to map the host's port 4000 to the container's port 80. Now you can reach the server at `http://localhost:4000`. Without port mapping, you would not be able to reach the container at localhost.

2. Open another terminal (in Cloud Shell, click the `+` icon), and test the server:
    

```apache
curl http://localhost:4000
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Hello World
```

The container will run as long as the initial terminal is running. If you want the container to run in the background (not tied to the terminal's session), you need to specify the `-d` flag.

3. Close the initial terminal and then run the following command to stop and remove the container:
    

```apache
docker stop my-app && docker rm my-app
```

4. Now run the following command to start the container in the background:
    

```apache
docker run -p 4000:80 --name my-app -d node-app:0.1

docker ps
```

(Command Output)

```apache
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND        CREATED         ...  NAMES
xxxxxxxxxxxx   node-app:0.1   "node app.js"  16 seconds ago  ...  my-app
```

5. Notice the container is running in the output of `docker ps`. You can look at the logs by executing `docker logs [container_id]`.
    

**Note:** You don't have to write the entire container ID, as long as the initial characters uniquely identify the container. For example, you can execute `docker logs 17b` if the container ID is `17bcaca6f....`

```apache
docker logs [container_id]
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/
```

Now modify the application.

1. In your Cloud Shell, open the test directory you created earlier in the lab:
    

```apache
cd test
```

2. Edit `app.js` with a text editor of your choice (for example nano or vim) and replace "Hello World" with another string:
    

```apache
....
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Welcome to Cloud\n');
});
....
```

3. Build this new image and tag it with `0.2`:
    

```apache
docker build -t node-app:0.2 .
```

(Command Output)

```apache
[+] Building 0.7s (8/8) FINISHED                                                                                                                                              docker:default
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                                                                                                       0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                                                                                                                                                         0.0s
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                                                                                    0.0s
 => => transferring dockerfile: 397B                                                                                                                                                    0.0s
 => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:lts                                                                                                                             0.5s
```

Notice in Step 2 that you are using an existing cache layer. From Step 3 and on, the layers are modified because you made a change in `app.js`.

4. Run another container with the new image version. Notice how we map the host's port 8080 instead of 80. You can't use host port 4000 because it's already in use.
    

```apache
docker run -p 8080:80 --name my-app-2 -d node-app:0.2
docker ps
```

(Command Output)

```apache
CONTAINER ID     IMAGE             COMMAND            CREATED
xxxxxxxxxxxx     node-app:0.2      "node app.js"      53 seconds ago      ...
xxxxxxxxxxxx     node-app:0.1      "node app.js"      About an hour ago   ...
```

5. Test the containers:
    

```apache
curl http://localhost:8080
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Welcome to Cloud
```

6. And now test the first container you made:
    

```apache
curl http://localhost:4000
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Hello World
```

## **Task 4. Debug**

Now that you're familiar with building and running containers, go over some debugging practices.

1. You can look at the logs of a container using `docker logs [container_id]`. If you want to follow the log's output as the container is running, use the `-f` option.
    

```apache
docker logs -f [container_id]
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/
```

Sometimes you will want to start an interactive Bash session inside the running container.

2. You can use `docker exec` to do this. Open another terminal (in Cloud Shell, click the + icon) and enter the following command:
    

```apache
docker exec -it [container_id] bash
```

The `-it` flags let you interact with a container by allocating a pseudo-tty and keeping stdin open. Notice bash ran in the `WORKDIR` directory (/app) specified in the `Dockerfile`. From here, you have an interactive shell session inside the container to debug.

(Command Output)

```apache
root@xxxxxxxxxxxx:/app#
```

3. Look at the directory
    

```apache
ls
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Dockerfile  app.js
```

4. Exit the Bash session:
    

```apache
exit
```

5. You can examine a container's metadata in Docker by using Docker inspect:
    

```apache
docker inspect [container_id]
```

(Command Output)

```apache
[
    {
        "Id": "xxxxxxxxxxxx....",
        "Created": "2017-08-07T22:57:49.261726726Z",
        "Path": "node",
        "Args": [
            "app.js"
        ],
...
```

6. Use `--format` to inspect specific fields from the returned JSON. For example:
    

```apache
docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' [container_id]
```

(Example Output)

```apache
192.168.9.3
```

Be sure to check out the following **Docker documentation** resources for more information on debugging:

* [Docker inspect reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/#examples)
    
* [Docker exec reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/)
    

## **Task 5. Publish**

Now you're going to push your image to the [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry). After that you'll remove all containers and images to simulate a fresh environment, and then pull and run your containers. This will demonstrate the portability of Docker containers.

To push images to your private registry hosted by Artifact Registry, you need to tag the images with a registry name. The format is `<regional-repository>-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image`.

### Create the target Docker repository (Using Cloud Console)

You must create a repository before you can push any images to it. Pushing an image can't trigger creation of a repository and the Cloud Build service account does not have permissions to create repositories.

1. From the **Navigation Menu**, under CI/CD navigate to **Artifact Registry** &gt; **Repositories**.
    
2. Click the **+CREATE REPOSITORY** icon next to repositories.
    
3. Specify `my-repository` as the repository name.
    
4. Choose **Docker** as the format.
    
5. Under Location Type, select **Region** and then choose the location : `us-east1`.
    
6. Click **Create**.
    

### Configure authentication

Before you can push or pull images, configure Docker to use the Google Cloud CLI to authenticate requests to Artifact Registry.

1. To set up authentication to Docker repositories in the region `us-east1`, run the following command in Cloud Shell:
    

```apache
gcloud auth configure-docker us-east1-docker.pkg.dev
```

2. Enter `Y` when prompted.
    

The command updates your Docker configuration. You can now connect with Artifact Registry in your Google Cloud project to push and pull images.

**Note:** Alternately you can use gcloud CLI for a streamlined command-line approach.

### Create an Artifact Registry repository (Using CLI)

1. Run the following commands to create an Artifact Repository.
    

```apache
gcloud artifacts repositories create my-repository --repository-format=docker --location=us-east1 --description="Docker repository"
```

**Note:** When you make a Google Cloud API call or use a command-line tool that requires credentials (such as the gcloud CLI, bq, or gsutil) with Cloud Shell for the first time, Cloud Shell prompts you with the [Authorize Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/auth) dialog. To allow the tool to use your credentials to make calls, click **Authorize**.

### Push the container to Artifact Registry

1. Change into the directory with your Dockerfile.
    

```apache
cd ~/test
```

2. Run the command to tag `node-app:0.2`.
    

```apache
docker build -t us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297/my-repository/node-app:0.2 .
```

3. Run the following command to check your built Docker images.
    

```apache
docker images
```

(Command Output)

```apache
REPOSITORY                      TAG         IMAGE ID          CREATED
node-app                        0.2         76b3beef845e      22 hours
us-east1-....node-app:0.2    0.2         76b3beef845e      22 hours
node-app                        0.1         f166cd2a9f10      26 hours
node                            lts         5a767079e3df      7 days
hello-world                     latest      1815c82652c0      7 weeks
```

4. Push this image to Artifact Registry.
    

```apache
docker push us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297/my-repository/node-app:0.2
```

Command output (yours may differ):

```apache
The push refers to a repository [us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297/my-repository/node-app:0.2]
057029400a4a: Pushed

```

5. After the push finishes, from the **Navigation Menu**, under CI/CD navigate to **Artifact Registry** &gt; **Repositories**.
    
6. Click on **my-repository**. You should see your `node-app` Docker container created:

### Test the image

You could start a new VM, ssh into that VM, and install gcloud. For simplicity, just remove all containers and images to simulate a fresh environment.

1. Stop and remove all containers:
    

```apache
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

You have to remove the child images (of `node:lts`) before you remove the node image.

2. Run the following command to remove all of the Docker images.
    

```apache
docker rmi us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297/my-repository/node-app:0.2
docker rmi node:lts
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq) # remove remaining images
docker images
```

(Command Output)

```apache
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

At this point you should have a pseudo-fresh environment.

3. Pull the image and run it.
    

```apache
docker run -p 4000:80 -d us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-01-9e1d59f84297/my-repository/node-app:0.2
```

4. Run a curl against the running container.
    

```apache
curl http://localhost:4000
```

(Command Output)

```apache
Welcome to Cloud
```

### Test completed task

Click **Check my progress** to verify your performed task. If you have successfully published a container image to Artifact Registry, you'll see an assessment score.

Publish your container image to Artifact Registry

**Check my progress**

Here the portability of containers is showcased. As long as Docker is installed on the host (either on-premise or VM), it can pull images from public or private registries and run containers based on that image. There are no application dependencies that have to be installed on the host except for Docker.
