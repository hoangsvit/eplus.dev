## **Overview**

Storing and querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. BigQuery is an [enterprise data warehouse](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/bigquery-data-warehouse) that solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let us handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.

You access BigQuery through the Cloud Console, the [command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/cli_tool), or by making calls to the [BigQuery REST API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2) using a variety of [client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) such as Java, .NET, or Python. There are also a variety of [third-party tools](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/third-party-tools) that you can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data or loading the data. In this lab you access BigQuery using the Cloud Console.

Using BigQuery in the Cloud Console will give you a visual interface to complete tasks like running queries, loading data, and exporting data. This hands-on lab shows you how to query tables in a public dataset and how to load sample data into BigQuery through the Cloud Console.

### What you'll do

In this lab you:

* Query a public dataset
    
* Create a custom table
    
* Load data into a table
    
* Query a table
    

## **Setup and requirements**

### Qwiklabs setup

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Cloud Console

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-75b49bee4db6@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    JkHECCZLUrjr
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

## **Task 1. Open BigQuery**

The BigQuery console provides an interface to query tables, including [public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) offered by BigQuery.

### Open the BigQuery console

1. In the Google Cloud Console, select **Navigation menu** &gt; **BigQuery**.
    

The **Welcome to BigQuery in the Cloud Console** message box opens. This message box provides a link to the quickstart guide and the release notes.

2. Click **Done**.
    

The BigQuery console opens.

## **Task 2. Query a public dataset**

In this section, you load a public dataset, USA Names, into BigQuery, then query the dataset to determine the most common names in the US between 1910 and 2013.

### Load USA Name dataset

1. In the Explorer pane, click **\+ ADD**.
    
2. In **ADD Data** window, select **Star a project by name**.
    
3. Enter project name as `bigquery-public-data` and click **STAR**.
    

The project `bigquery-public-data` is added to your resources and you see the dataset `usa_names` listed in the left pane in your **Explorer** section under `bigquery-public-data`.

7. Click **usa\_names** to expand the dataset.
    
8. Click **usa\_1910\_2013** to open that table.
    

### Query the USA Names dataset

Query `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013` for the name and gender of the babies in this dataset, and then list the top 10 names in descending order.

1. Click **Query** &gt; **In a new tab**.
    
2. Remove the default query text in the **Query editor**.
    
3. Copy and paste the following query into the query **EDITOR** text area:
    

```sql
SELECT
  name, gender,
  SUM(number) AS total
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
GROUP BY
  name, gender
ORDER BY
  total DESC
LIMIT
  10
```

4. In the upper right of the window, view the query validator.
    

![Query Editor with query validator highlighted](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ZDEFSuoCtEPL%2F8czreXdZT5kEcbl5MCsCEj3uFlcgyc%3D align="left")

BigQuery displays a green check mark icon if the query is valid. If the query is invalid, a red exclamation point icon is displayed. When the query is valid, the validator also shows the amount of data the query processes when you run it. This helps to determine the cost of running the query.

5. Click **Run**.
    

The query results opens below the Query editor. At the top of the Query results section, BigQuery displays the time elapsed and the data processed by the query. Below the time is the table that displays the query results. The header row contains the name of the column as specified in `GROUP BY` in the query.

## **Task 3. Create a custom table**

In this section, you create a custom table, load data into it, and then run a query against the table.

### Download the data to your local computer

The file you're downloading contains approximately 7 MB of data about popular baby names, and it is provided by the US Social Security Administration.

1. Download the [baby names zip file](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/names.zip) to your local computer.
    
2. Unzip the file onto your computer.
    
3. Open the file named `yob2014.txt` to see what the data looks like. The file is a comma-separated value (CSV) file with the following three columns: name, sex (`M` or `F`), and number of children with that name. The file has no header row.
    
4. Note the location of the `yob2014.txt` file so that you can find it later.
    

## **Task 4. Create a dataset**

In this section, you create a dataset to hold your table, add data to your project, then make the data table you'll query against.

Datasets help you control access to tables and views in a project. This lab uses only one table, but you still need a dataset to hold the table.

1. Back in the console, in the **Explorer** section, click on the **View actions** icon next to your project ID and select **Create dataset**.
    
2. On the **Create dataset** page:
    

* For **Dataset ID**, enter `babynames`.
    
* For **Data location**, choose **us (multiple regions in United States)**.
    
* For **Default table expiration**, leave the default value.
    

Currently, the public datasets are stored in the US multi-region [location](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations). For simplicity, place your dataset in the same location.

## **Task 5. Load the data into a new table**

In this section, you load data into the table you made.

1. Create a table by clicking on the **View actions** icon next to your **babynames** dataset in the **Explorer** section. Select **Open**, then click **Create table**.
    

Use the default values for all settings unless otherwise indicated.

2. On the **Create table** page:
    

* For **Create table from**, choose **Upload** from the dropdown menu.
    
* For **Select file**, click **Browse**, navigate to the `yob2014.txt` file and click **Open**.
    
* For **File format**, choose **CSV** from the dropdown menu.
    
* For **Table name**, enter `names_2014`.
    
* In the **Schema** section, click the **Edit as text** toggle and paste the following schema definition in the text box.
    

```apache
name:string,gender:string,count:integer
```

3. Click **Create table** (at the bottom of the window).
    
4. Wait for BigQuery to create the table and load the data. While BigQuery loads the data, you can check the status from **Personal history** pane.
    

### Preview the table

1. In the left pane, select **babynames** &gt; **names\_2014** in the navigation panel.
    
2. In the details panel, click the **Preview** tab.
    

![Preview tabbed page displaying several rows of data below the four column headings: Row, name, gender, and count](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/K8qmzq%2Bv5GkyPNw3%2BmjeLQMt75wjZZWzIeNO7DZZ98M%3D align="left")

Quick quiz. You need a table to hold the datasetTrueFalse

## **Task 6. Query the table**

Now that you've loaded data into your table, you can run queries against it. The process is identical to the previous example, except that this time, you're querying your table instead of a public table.

1. Click **Query** &gt; **In a new tab**.
    
2. Remove the default query text in the **Query editor**.
    
3. Copy and paste the following query into the query **EDITOR**. This query retrieves the top 5 baby names for US males in 2014.
    

```sql
SELECT
 name, count
FROM
 `babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
 gender = 'M'
ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5
```

3. Click **Run**. The results are displayed below the query window.
    

Click **Check my progress** to verify the objective.
