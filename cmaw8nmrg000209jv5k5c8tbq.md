# Introducing Laravel Cascade Soft Deletes: Efficient Soft Delete Management

When developing web applications with **Laravel**, managing related data across database tables is a critical task. For instance, when deleting a parent record, such as a blog post, you often want to remove associated child records, like comments, to keep your data clean and consistent. The **laravel-cascade-soft-deletes** package by Michael Dyrynda addresses this challenge effectively, especially when leveraging Laravel’s **soft deletes** feature.

## Soft Deletes and the Challenge

Laravel’s **soft delete** functionality, provided by the `SoftDeletes` trait, allows you to mark records as "deleted" without removing them from the database. This is invaluable for restoring data later. However, when using soft deletes, you lose the ability to automatically delete related child records through database foreign key constraints like `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

The **laravel-cascade-soft-deletes** package bridges this gap. It enables automatic soft deletion of child records when a parent record is soft deleted, supporting cascading soft deletes for nested relationships.

## Key Features

* **Automatic child record soft deletion**: When a parent record is soft deleted, all related child records (defined in the `$cascadeDeletes` array) are also soft deleted.
    
* **Cascading soft deletes**: If child records also use the `CascadeSoftDeletes` trait, their children (grandchildren) will be soft deleted, creating a chain of cascading deletions.
    
* **Customizable data fetching**: Supports methods like `get`, `cursor`, `lazy`, or `chunk` to optimize performance when handling large datasets.
    
* **Robust error handling**: The package throws a `LogicException` if the model lacks the `SoftDeletes` trait or if defined `$cascadeDeletes` relationships are invalid or non-existent.
    

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Install the package via **Composer**:

```apache
composer require dyrynda/laravel-cascade-soft-deletes
```

### Example Usage

Here’s how to integrate the package into a `Post` model to automatically soft delete related comments:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use App\Comment;
use Dyrynda\Database\Support\CascadeSoftDeletes;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class Post extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes, CascadeSoftDeletes;

    protected $cascadeDeletes = ['comments'];

    protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];

    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}
```

After configuration, soft deleting a post:

```php
$post = App\Post::find($postId);
$post->delete();
```

This will soft delete the post and all related `App\Comment` records. If the `Comment` model also uses `CascadeSoftDeletes`, its child records (if any) will be soft deleted as well.

### Important Notes

* **Data restoration**: Restoring a parent record does not automatically restore soft-deleted child records, as there’s no way to distinguish whether they were deleted via cascading or independently.
    
* **Performance**: For relationships with large datasets, you can customize `$fetchMethod` (e.g., `chunk` or `lazy`) and `$chunkSize` to optimize performance.
