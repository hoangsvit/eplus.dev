## **Overview**

With Google Drive, you can store all your files in the cloud, including photos, Microsoft® Word® documents, Excel® spreadsheets, and more. You can also make changes to a Word file using Google Docs, or convert your Word files to Google Docs.

You open files in your Drive folder on a desktop or from your browser. Files you create with Google Docs open in your browser or mobile app. Other files in your Drive folder open in their regular applications (like Adobe® Reader® for PDF® files) on your computer.

**Note:** To use Google Drive on your Android or IOS mobile devices, install the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs) or [IOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive-free-online-storage/id507874739). See [How to use Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2424384?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=0) for more information.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you use Drive to:

* Upload and store files.
    
* Access, view, and update your files.
    
* Organize and search your files.
    
* Share your files to collaborate with team mates.
    

### Prerequisites

You will need some files and folders on your local computer to upload to Drive.

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### Start your lab

1. When you are ready, click **Start Lab** in the upper left panel.
    
    The Lab Details pane appears with the temporary credentials that you must use to sign into Gmail for this lab.
    
    If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method.
    
2. Click **Open Google Drive**.
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-04-1543565078e7@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    8Tz5eaWlvi6M
    ```
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
7. Accept all terms and conditions as prompted.
    

Google Drive opens and you are signed in to the Student Google Account.

## **Task 1. Upload and store**

You can store any file in Drive: pictures, drawings, videos, and more. After you store a file in Drive from one device, it is automatically available on all your other devices.

### Upload files to Drive

To store files in Drive, use your web browser to upload them.

**Note:** If you’re using a supported browser, you can simply drag files directly from your computer to the Drive page on your browser.

1. In the left pane, click **New &gt; File upload**.
    
2. Choose a file on your computer and click **Open**.
    

When you see **Upload complete** in the bottom right, your file has uploaded successfully and can be accessed in any browser or device that has Drive installed.

3. Click **New &gt; Folder upload**.
    
4. Upload a few files and/or folders from your local computer to use later in this lab.
    

If you upload a file or folder with a name that matches the name of an existing file or folder, Drive gives you the option of Replacing the existing file or folder, or Keeping both files or folder.

5. Click **New &gt; File upload**.
    
6. On your computer, choose the same file you previously uploaded and click **Open**.
    
7. Select **Replace existing file** and click **Upload**.
    

You may want to view or manage previous versions of the file or folder.

8. In Drive, right click on the file you just uploaded and click **File information** &gt; **Manage versions**.
    
9. You will see Version 1 of the file.
    

**Note:** To manage previous versions of a file, see [Check or revert to earlier file versions](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308971).

* To work on files from your desktop, see [Store files on your desktop](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310458?hl=en&ref_topic=9296420#1.2).
    
* To upload files from your phone or tablet, see [Upload files from your phone or tablet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310458?hl=en&ref_topic=9296420#1.3).
    

When you upload a file or folder, you see a message with "upload complete" and green checks next to the files listed, the files have uploaded successfully.

![Upload complete message box](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/AW0Dz8HNcNmRpzdi3pWyFZVD9xtHDOMSjrJfuoB%2BHJg%3D align="left")

You can use a browser or [any device with Drive installed](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310247?hl=en&ref_topic=9296420) to access the uploaded files.

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## **Task 2. Access your files**

You can access files in Drive wherever you go — on your computer, phone, or tablet. When you update a file in Drive, Drive automatically syncs the changes. For example, if you update a file on your tablet, you can open the file on your laptop and see that update.

### Access your files offline

**Note:** This lab does not support offline access, however here are steps you would use in your personal Google Account.

**Set up offline access for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides**

1. In Drive, click **Settings**

### Delete your files

If you remove a file you own in Drive on any device, it's automatically removed from Drive on all of your devices and on the web.

**Note:** Removed files you own are moved to Trash in Drive and still count towards your total storage, until you permanently delete them on the web.

### Move files to folders

Move a file to a folder in My Drive:

1. The easiest way to move a file into a folder is to drag and drop it into the folder.
    
2. The other way is to right click on a file &gt; **Organize** &gt; **Move** and then choose a folder.
    

### Star important files and folders

2. In the left pane, click **Starred** to see all your starred files and folders.

It's hard to browse through hundreds of files just to find the one you need. So, try searching Drive instead.

**Search for files or folders in Drive:**

To help you search faster, Drive suggests search terms as you enter text.

2. Click a suggestion to open it or click **Search** to see a list of results.

* **Owner**—Search by file owner.
    
* **Location**—Search by location (including items in the Trash or Starred). You can only search for folders that are in My Drive or Team Drives. To search a folder that is shared with you, you must first add the folder to My Drive.
    
* **Date modified**—See items that were recently modified by anyone (not just you).
    
* **Item name**—Search for a term in the file name.
    
* **Has the words**—Search for files that contain certain words.
    
* **Shared to**—Search for someone that has access to the file.
    
* **Follow up**—Search for files you own with suggestions, or files with action items assigned to you.
    

2. Click **SEARCH**.
    

## **Task 5. Share and collaborate**

After you share Drive files or folders, you can work on them with teammates or even people outside of your company.

This section describes how to:

* Share files and set access levels and visibility.
    
* View Drive activity and file details.
