1. **Amazon has been collecting review data for a particular product. They have realized that almost 90% of the reviews were mostly a 5/5 rating. However, of the 90%, they realized that 50% of them were customers who did not have proof of purchase or customers who did not post serious reviews about the product. Of the following, which is true about the review data collected in this situation?**
    
    * <mark>Low Veracity</mark>
        
    * High Veracity
        
    * Low Volume
        
    * Low Valence
        
    * High Valence
        
    * High Volume
        
2. **As mentioned in the slides, what are the challenges to data with a high valence?**
    
    * Complex Data Exploration Algorithms
        
    * Difficult to Integrate
        
    * <mark>Reliability of Data</mark>
        
3. **Which of the following are the 6 V's in big data?**
    
    * <mark>Volume</mark>
        
    * Vision
        
    * <mark>Variety</mark>
        
    * Valence
        
    * <mark>Velocity</mark>
        
    * <mark>Value</mark>
        
    * <mark>Veracity</mark>
        
4. **What is the veracity of big data?**
    
    * The size of the data.
        
    * <mark>The abnormality or uncertainties of data.</mark>
        
    * The connectedness of data.
        
    * The speed at which data is produced.
        
5. **What are the challenges of data with high variety?**
    
    * Hard to perform emergent behavior analysis.
        
    * Hard in utilizing group event detection.
        
    * <mark>Hard to integrate.</mark>
        
    * The quality of data is low.
        
6. **Which of the following is the best way to describe why it is crucial to process data in real-time?**
    
    * More accurate.
        
    * More expensive to batch process.
        
    * <mark>Prevents missed opportunities.</mark>
        
    * Batch processing is an older method that is not as accurate as real-time processing.
        
7. **What are the challenges with big data that has high volume?**
    
    * Speed Increase in Processing
        
    * Storage and Accessibility
