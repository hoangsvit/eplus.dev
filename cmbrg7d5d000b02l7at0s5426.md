### Prerequisites

Before you start this lab, make sure you get familiar with the following:

* [EOSIO Platform and Toolchain](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/introduction-to-eosio/platform_and_toolchain)
    
* [EOSIO Core Concepts](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/introduction-to-eosio/core_concepts)
    
* [EOSIO Technical Features](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/introduction-to-eosio/technical_features)
    

## Setup and requirements

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Username"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    "Password"
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

## Background

This section provides an overview of the EOSIO concepts covered in this lab.

### EOSIO Blockchain

An EOSIO blockchain is a highly efficient, deterministic, distributed state machine that can operate in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain keeps track of transactions within a sequence of interchanged blocks.

Each block cryptographically commits to the previous blocks along the same chain. It is therefore intractable to modify a transaction recorded on a given block without breaking the cryptographic checks of successive blocks. This simple fact makes blockchain transactions immutable and secure. Block production and block validation are performed by special nodes called Block Producers.

### EOSIO Consensus

Block validation presents a challenge among any group of distributed nodes. A consensus model must be in place to validate such blocks in a fault tolerant way within the decentralized system. Consensus is the way for such distributed nodes and users to agree upon the current state of the blockchain. Two of the most common consensus models used in blockchains are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). In Proof of Stake, nodes that own the largest stake or percentage of some asset have equivalent decision power.

One interesting variant is Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) in which a large number of participants or stakeholders elect a smaller number of delegates, which in turn make decisions for them. EOSIO uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to elect the active producers who will then be authorized to produce blocks, validate them, and sign them to eventually be added to the blockchain.

### EOSIO Accounts, Keys, and Permissions

An account identifies a participant in an EOSIO blockchain. A participant can be an individual or a group depending on the assigned permissions within the account. Accounts also represent the smart contract actors that push and receive actions to and from other accounts in the blockchain. Keys in EOSIO are binary strings represented in Base58 used for signing and verification of transactions, blocks, and other messages. Keys are created within a digital wallet associated with an account.

Since account ownership is defined solely by the account name, the keys associated with an account can be updated without compromising security. A novel permission scheme involving accounts, permissions, and authority tables determine what accounts can do and how the actions that make a transaction are authorized. To that end, each account is assigned a hierarchical permission structure and each permission is assigned a pair of public and private keys used for signing and verification.

## Task 5. Add the EOSIO system account private key to the new wallet

Every new EOSIO blockchain has a default system user called eosio. This account is used initially to set up the blockchain. It defaults to the private key, `5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3`. Import this private key to your wallet to sign transactions on behalf of the eosio user.

1. At the command prompt on `my-vm-1`, use the `cleos wallet open` command to open the **my\_wallet** wallet:
    

```apache
cleos wallet open --name my_wallet
```

The response will be:

```apache
Opened: my_wallet
```

2. Copy the wallet password from the **my\_wallet\_password** file.
    
3. Use the `cleos wallet unlock` command to unlock the **my\_wallet** wallet, add the wallet password in to `YOUR_PASSWORD`:
    

```apache
cleos wallet unlock --name my_wallet --password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

The response will be:

```apache
Unlocked: my_wallet
```

4. Use the `cleos wallet import` command to import the EOSIO private key, `5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3`, to the **my\_wallet** wallet:
    

```apache
cleos wallet import --name my_wallet --private-key 5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
```

The response will be:

```

2. Copy the wallet password from the `my_wallet_password` file:
    

```apache
export wallet_password=$(cat my_wallet_password)
echo $wallet_password
```

3. Use the `cleos wallet unlock` command to unlock the **my\_wallet** wallet, using the `$wallet_password` environment variable you just created:
    

```apache
cleos wallet unlock --name my_wallet --password $wallet_password
```

The response will be:

```apache
Unlocked: my_wallet
```

4. Use the `cleos create key` command to create a public/private key pair to use with the blockchain account:
    

```apache
cleos create key --file my_keypair1
```
