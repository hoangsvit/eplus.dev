## **Overview**

[Sensitive Data Protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/sensitive-data-protection) is a fully managed service designed to help you discover, classify, and protect sensitive information. Key options include Sensitive Data Discovery for continuously profiling your sensitive data, de-identification of sensitive data including redaction, and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API to let you build in discovery, inspection, and de-identification into custom workloads and applications.

You can protect sensitive data in BigQuery by leveraging Sensitive Data Protection along with Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Google Cloud to automatically tag sensitive data during discovery scans and grant conditional access to BigQuery data for users in your organization.

In this lab, you begin by creating a discovery scan configuration for BigQuery in paused mode. Then, you create a tag to flag sensitive data in BigQuery and update the discovery scan configuration to use the created tag for automated scanning. Last, you use the created tag to grant conditional access to BigQuery data for additional users.

### What you'll learn

In this lab, you learn how to:

* Create a discovery scan configuration for BigQuery in paused mode.
    
* Create tags and grant roles for automated tagging during discovery scan.
    
* Update the paused discovery scan to use the created tags for automated tagging and start scan.
    
* Grant conditional access to BigQuery data using tags.
    

## **Setup and requirements**

### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
    

**Note:** Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.

* Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
    

**Note:** Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console

1. Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:
    
    * The Open Google Cloud console button
        
    * Time remaining
        
    * The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
        
    * Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
        
2. Click **Open Google Cloud console** (or right-click and select **Open Link in Incognito Window** if you are running the Chrome browser).
    
    The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.
    
    ***Tip:*** Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
    
    **Note:** If you see the **Choose an account** dialog, click **Use Another Account**.
    
3. If necessary, copy the **Username** below and paste it into the **Sign in** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    student-03-589123a26bb1@qwiklabs.net
    ```
    
    You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.
    
4. Click **Next**.
    
5. Copy the **Password** below and paste it into the **Welcome** dialog.
    
    ```apache
    kom0ZKWsbpW2
    ```
    
    You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.
    
6. Click **Next**.
    
    **Important:** You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
    
    **Note:** Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
    
7. Click through the subsequent pages:
    
    * Accept the terms and conditions.
        
    * Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
        
    * Do not sign up for free trials.
        

After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

**Note:** To access Google Cloud products and services, click the **Navigation menu** or type the service or product name in the **Search** field.

## **Task 1. Create a discovery scan configuration for BigQuery in paused mode**

The discovery service within Sensitive Data Protection empowers you to identify where sensitive and high-risk data reside across your organization. When you create a discovery scan configuration, Sensitive Data Protection scans the resources you select for review and generates [data profiles](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/data-profiles), which are a set of insights on the [infoTypes](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/infotypes-reference) (types of sensitive data) identified and metadata on data risk and sensitivity level.

In this task, you create a discovery scan to automatically profile data in BigQuery. As it can take some time for the full discovery results to be generated, you are provided with highlights and summaries of the key results in the last task of the lab.

1. In the Google Cloud console, click on the **Navigation menu** () &gt; **Security**.
    
2. Under **Data Protection**, click **Sensitive Data Protection**.
    
3. Click the tab named **Discovery**.
    
4. Under **BigQuery**, click **Enable**.
    
5. For **Select a discovery type**, leave the option enabled for **BigQuery**, and click **Continue**.
    
6. For **Select scope**, leave the option enabled for **Scan selected project**, and click **Continue**.
    
7. For **Managed schedules**, leave the default, click **Continue**.
    
    In this lab, you are scheduling the discovery scan to run immediately after creation, but there are many options for scheduling scans to run on a periodic basis (such as daily or weekly) or after certain events (such as when an inspection template is updated.)
    
8. For **Select inspection template**, leave the option enabled for **Create new inspection template**.
    
9. Leave all other defaults, and click **Continue**.
    
    By default, the new inspection template includes all existing infoTypes.
    
    For **Confidence threshold**, the default for **Minimum** [**likelihood**](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/likelihood) is **Possible**, which means that you get only the findings that are evaluated as **Possible**, **Likely**, and **Very\_Likely**.
    
    In a later task, you modify this inspection template to explore other options for infoTypes and confidence threshold.
    
10. For **Add actions**, enable **Publish to Security Command Center**.
    
11. For **Add actions**, also enable **Save data profile copies to BigQuery** and provide the dataset and table (which have been pre-created in this lab) to save the results to BigQuery.
    

| **Property** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| **Project ID** | `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c` |
| **Dataset ID** | **bq\_discovery** |
| **Table ID** | **data\_profiles** |

Notice the message under the action for **Tag resources** about the service agent needing a specific role for automated tagging to occur.

In the next task, you create the tags and grant the necessary role to the service account for automated tagging during the discovery scan.

12. Leave all other defaults, and click **Continue**.
    
13. For **Set location to store configuration**, leave the option enabled for **us (multiple regions in United States)**, and click **Continue**.
    
14. Provide a display name for this config: **BigQuery Discovery**
    
15. Enable **Create scan in paused mode**.
    

This creates the discovery scan configuration but does not start the scan yet, so that you can create the tags and grant the appropriate IAM role to the service agent ID for the discovery scan.

16. Click **Create**, and then confirm the creation by clicking **Create configuration**.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## **Task 2. Create tags and grant role for automated tagging during discovery scan**

Within IAM, you can create a [sensitivity level tag](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/control-access-based-on-data-sensitivity#grant-conditional-access) that you can use to automatically tag resources during discovery scans and to grant or deny access to specific resources that are tagged with the sensitivity level tag.

In this task, you create a sensitivity level tag in IAM with four tag values that represent different levels of sensitivity: low, moderate, high, and unknown.

### Create a sensitivity level tag in IAM

1. In the Google Cloud console, click on the **Navigation menu** () &gt; **IAM & Admin** &gt; **Tags**.
    
2. Click **\+ Create**.
    
3. For **Tag key**, type a display name for your tag: `sensitivity-level`
    
4. For **Tag description**, type a description for this tag: `Sensitivity level tagged as low, moderate, high, and unknown`
    
5. Click **\+ Add value**.
    
6. For **Tag value**, type a display name for your first tag value: `low`
    
7. For **Tag value description**, type a description for this tag value: `Tag value to attach to low-sensitivity data`
    
8. Repeat steps 5-7 to create three more tag values:
    

| **Tag value** | **Tag description** |
| --- | --- |
| `moderate` | `Tag value to attach to moderate-sensitivity data` |
| `high` | `Tag value to attach to high-sensitivity data` |
| `unknown` | `Tag value to attach to resources with an unknown sensitivity level` |

9. Click **Create tag key**.
    

It may take a minute for the tag key to be created.

10. After the tag key is created, click on the tag key name to see the details.
    

Note that the tag key has a tag key path (`qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level) and the following tag values: `high`, `low`, `moderate`, `unknown`

Combining the tag key path with the tag value provides the tag value path, which you use in the next task. For example:

* `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level/high
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

### Grant role to service account for discovery scan using IAM

To automatically tag resources, the service agent needs the `resourcemanager.tagUser` role. In this section, you follow the steps provided in the documentation titled [Control IAM access based on data sensitivity](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/control-access-based-on-data-sensitivity?_gl=1*m8g9mm*_ga*NTkxMjY1MDA2LjE3MjYzNDI0MjY.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcyNjM0MjQyNi4xLjEuMTcyNjM0Mjk4Ny4yMS4wLjA.#grant-service-agent-permission-on-tag) to grant this role.

1. Click **Activate Cloud Shell**
    
    ![Activate Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ep8HmqYGdD%2FkUncAAYpV47OYoHwC8%2Bg0WK%2F8sidHquE%3D align="left")
    
    at the top of the Google Cloud console.
    

If prompted, click **Continue**.

2. Run the following command to create a variable for the Project Number of your current project:
    

```apache
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c --format="get(projectNumber)")
```

If prompted, click **Authorize**.

3. Run the following command to grant the tag user role to the service account for the discovery scan:
    

```apache
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c --member=serviceAccount:service-$PROJECT_NUMBER@dlp-api.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/resourcemanager.tagUser
```

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

## **Task 3. Update the paused discovery scan with automated tagging and start scan**

Now that you have granted the service account with the appropriate role for automatic tagging, you can enable the tag resources options in the discovery scan.

### Add tag values and start discovery scan

1. Return to [**Sensitive Data Protection**](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/sensitive-data-protection/) overview page.
    
2. Under **Discovery** &gt; **Scan Configurations** tab, locate the row named **BigQuery Discovery**. Click **View actions** (icon with three vertical dots) for that row, and select **Edit**.
    
3. Under **Add actions**, enable **Tag resources** and the following related options:
    

| **Property** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| **Tag high sensitivity resources** | Enable and provide the tag value: `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level/high |
| **Tag moderate sensitivity resources** | Enable and provide the tag value: `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level/moderate |
| **Tag low sensitivity resources** | Enable and provide the tag value: `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level/low |
| **Tag unknown sensitivity resources** | Enable and provide the tag value: `qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`/sensitivity-level/unknown |

4. Also, enable the following two options:
    
    * When a tag is applied to a resource, lower the data risk of its profile to LOW.
        
    * Tag a resource when it is profiled for the first time.
        
5. Click **Save**, and then click **Confirm edit**.
    
6. Last, click **Resume Scan** to start the discovery scan.
    

Click *Check my progress* to verify the objective.

### What discovery results can tell you about your data

**Note:** After the configuration scan begins, it may be some time before full results are available.

The images below display the key results of enabling discovery for BigQuery in this lab environment.

For the BigQuery data included in this lab environment, the results have flagged the potential presence of several infoTypes including US Social Security numbers, which are highly sensitive data.

#### **Image 1. Discovery for BigQuery enabled in UI**

Three profiles have been identified for BigQuery: two with low sensitivity (one dataset for the discovery results and one dataset for damaged car image metadata) and one with high sensitivity (dataset containing details on car buyers).

![Discovery for BigQuery enabled in UI](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/D%2FvZeHTgEQOmT3awx53NCGFTbDyHq049HKEsFdNB%2Fss%3D align="left")

#### **Image 2. Sensitive data inventory details**

This section of the results provides the global location of the three data profiles. In this example, both are in the `us-central1` region.

![Sensitive data inventory details for BigQuery](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/CxV8opYBt59cLS1wqGB%2BA%2FB1iMHH0zFEdEVyRjTSe0M%3D align="left")

#### **Image 3. BigQuery profiles with infoTypes**

The discovery results also provide the key infoTypes identified in BigQuery: US Social Security number, email address, name, etc.

![BigQueryprofiles with infoTypes](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/IqSsuhKd3UFUBKF8CYM4O%2FdWU9B5lST%2F8v5Aq0nJ600%3D align="left")

#### **Image 4. Profiles tab of the discovery results**

The **Profiles** tab identifies the sensitivity and risk levels for each specific BigQuery dataset name: one with low sensitivity (empty bucket to receive output from jobs) and one with high sensitivity (bucket containing raw data including US Social Security number).

In this lab environment, be sure to select the **Location type** as **Region** &gt; `us-central1` to view the profiles.

## **Task 4. Explore conditional access for BigQuery using tags**

Using IAM, you can grant a role to a user based on a sensitivity level tag attached to a specific resource using [conditional role bindings](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-conditional-role-bindings#add). For example, you can grant a user access to only BigQuery data that have been tagged as low sensitivity. The user would no longer be able to access any BigQuery that did not have the tag including untagged BigQuery.

In this task, you begin by reviewing the existing BigQuery access that has been granted to Username 2 in this lab environment. Then, you update the access for Username 2 to be conditional based on the low sensitivity data tag, and manually assign that low sensitivity tag to one of the BigQuery datasets. Last, you test the updated BigQuery access for Username 2 to verify conditional access.

### Test current BigQuery access as Username 2

For this section, begin by logging into the Google Cloud project as **Username 2** (`student-01-e1396eaa9824@qwiklabs.net`). Expand the hint below for help with switching to a new user.

10. Click **Save**, and then click **Save** again.
    

### Add low sensitivity tag to BigQuery dataset

For this section, remain logged in as **Username 1** (`student-03-589123a26bb1@qwiklabs.net`).

Recall that the full discovery scan takes some time to complete, so there aren't any BigQuery datasets that have been tagged with the sensitivity level tags yet.

To test conditional access, you manually assign the low sensitivity tag to the BigQuery dataset named **damaged\_car\_image\_info**, which does not contain sensitive data.

1. In the Google Cloud console, click on the **Navigation menu** () &gt; **BigQuery**.
    
2. In the Explorer panel, expand the arrow next to the project ID (`qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`) to see the list of BigQuery datasets.
    
3. Click on **damaged\_car\_image\_info** to open the dataset info tab, and then click **Edit details** (pencil icon).
    
4. Under **Tags**, click **Select scope** &gt; **Select current project**.

Click here for hint!

As Username 2, complete the following steps to check the conditional BigQuery access that has been granted to Username 2.

1. Return to BigQuery by clicking on the **Navigation menu** () &gt; **BigQuery**.
    
2. In the data explorer panel, expand the arrow next to the project ID (`qwiklabs-gcp-01-f8baec13cb8c`) to see the list of BigQuery datasets.
    
    After the IAM role is updated with the appropriate condition, there is only one BigQuery dataset listed because it is the only one with the low sensitivity tag:
    
    * **damaged\_car\_image\_info**
        

**Note:** It may take 5 to 10 minutes for the IAM role updates to fully propagate. You can keep refreshing the BigQuery page until you see that there is only one BigQuery dataset remaining: **damaged\_car\_image\_info**.

3. Log out of the project as Username 2.
