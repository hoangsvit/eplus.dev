1. **(Questions 1-3 pertain to the video lecture “Exploring the Relational Data Model of CSV”)**
    
    What is the approximate population of La Paz county in the state of Arizona for the CENSUS2010POP (column H)? (Choose the best answer.)
    
    * 15000
        
    * 25000
        
    * <mark>20000</mark>
        
    * 10000
        
2. **What county in the state of Wyoming has the smallest estimated population?**
    
    * <mark>Niobrara</mark>
        
    * Uinta
        
    * Sweetwater

3. **At 2:45 of the video, the Instructor creates a filter for all of the counties in California with a population greater than 1,000,000. However, included in the results is the entire state of California. This anomalous value might skew our analysis if, for example, we wanted to compute the average population of these results. What additional filter might work to resolve this problem?**
    
    * <mark>Add a filter to detect and remove results which do not include the word “County” in column G.</mark>
        
    * Add a filter which finds all counties with population greater than 100,000 AND less than 10,000,000 for column H (CENSUS2010POP).
        
    * Add a filter where the value in column E is greater than 1,000,000.
        
    * None of the above
        
4. **(Questions 4 and 5 pertain to the video "Exploring Sensor Data")**
    
    How often (in seconds) do the R5 measurements occur?
    
    * 40
        
    * 50
        
    * <mark>60</mark>
        
    * 30
        
5. What is the field for rain accumulation?
    
    * Dn
        
    * <mark>Rc</mark>
        
    * Dx
        
    * Sm
        
6. **(Questions 6 and 7 pertain to the video lecture "Exploring the Array Data Model of an Image")**
    
    What is the (Red, Green, Blue) pixel value for location 500, 2000?
    
    * (134, 145, 46)
        
    * (100, 123, 149)
        
    * <mark>(163, 118, 79)</mark>
        
    * (50, 156, 182)
        
7. **Is this value likely to be land or ocean?**
    
    * Ocean
        
    * <mark>Land</mark>
        
8. **(Questions 8 and 9 pertain to the video lecture "Exploring the Semistructured Data Model of JSON")**
    
    Given a tweet, what path would you most likely enter to obtain a count of the number of followers for a user?
