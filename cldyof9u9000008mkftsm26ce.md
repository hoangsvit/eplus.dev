Having a slow test suite can be frustrating. Sitting around for 30 seconds or more every time you want to run your tests is not fun. To help combat this, a new feature coming to [**Laravel 10**](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-10) is a `--profile` option that will make it easy for you to find any slow tests in your application.

Below is an example of the output as shared by [**nuno maduro**](https://twitter.com/enunomaduro/status/1623025145571905553):

This `--profile` option should help keep your [**tests fast**](https://laravel-news.com/tips-to-speed-up-phpunit-tests) and help you either fix the slow tests or to better group them to make it easier not to run them all the time.
