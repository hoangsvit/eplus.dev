**REQUIREMENTS**

* Know the basics of Python
    
* A computer & access to internet
    

**DESCRIPTION**

Are you ready to become a true **Python programmer** and learn some of the **most demanded** skills on the market in programming for 2023?

**Who is this course for?**

This course is for anyone who wants to practise their Python skills and **improve them significantly** with real projects! *It's important that you already have a basic understanding of the Python language before taking this course*, but I will explain everything I do in **great detail** so that you can learn how to create your own projects **more easily!**

**Why should you pick this course and not the others?**

There are thousands of Python courses on the internet, so why should you pick this one? Well, to put it simply, I believe that I teach programming concepts in a **far more effective** way than a majority of the courses on the Internet. I make sure to only teach what's essential and needed, so that you **don't waste time** with code that you will never see or use in your entire career. I'm a **self-taught professional** and will teach you how you can be the same!

**30 Day Money-Back Guarantee**

At any point of this course you can opt in to get your money back. Whether you feel that this course is not right for you, or changed your mind about learning Python, you can easily request a refund which will be immediately refunded to your account with no questions asked through Udemy!

**WHOâ€™S THIS CLASS FOR:**

* Python developers who want to master Python with real projects.
