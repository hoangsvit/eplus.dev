**IMPORTANT NOTE** *(Read me before seeing the milestones below)*:

Earning any of the milestones below does **NOT** make you eligible for any swags/prizes. Note that, in the facilitator program, you are mainly just earning "Bonus" points that you can accumulate and add to your "Arcade" points to reach the actual Skills Boost Arcade Player achievements and thus become eligible for swags/prizes.
