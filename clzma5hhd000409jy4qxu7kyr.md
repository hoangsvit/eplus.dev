## **Overview**

Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

**What you'll do**

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use the Cloud console to:

* Create a storage bucket
    
* Upload objects to the bucket
    
* Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
    
* Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible
    

---

### **Task 1. Create a bucket**

*Buckets* are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.

To create a bucket:

1. In the Cloud console, go to **Navigation menu** &gt; **Cloud Storage** &gt; **Buckets**.
    
2. Click **\+ Create**:

3. Enter your bucket information and click **Continue** to complete each step:
    
    * **Name your bucket:** Enter a unique name for your bucket. For this lab, you can use your **Project ID** as the bucket name because it will always be unique.
        
    
    **Bucket naming rules:**
    
    * Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
        
    * Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (\_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require [verification](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification).
        
    * Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
        
    * Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
        
    * Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
        
    * Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix. Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".\*
        
    * Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (\_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.
        
    * Choose **Region** for **Location type** and `europe-west1` for **Location**.
        
    * Choose **Standard** for **default storage class**.
        
    * Choose **Uniform** for **Access control** and **uncheck** *Enforce public access prevention on this bucket* to turn it off.
        
4. Leave the rest of the fields as their default values and click **Create**.
    

That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

**Note:** If you are prompted with Public access will be prevented, uncheck *Enforce public access prevention on this bucket* and click **Confirm**.

Every bucket must have a unique name across the entire Cloud Storage namespace.TrueFalse

### **Task 2. Upload an object into the bucket**

![Kitten image](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/8tnHNHkj30vDqnzokQ%2FcKrxmOLoxgfaswd9nuZkEjd8%3D align="left")

To upload the image above into your new bucket:

1. Right-click on the image above and download it to your computer. Save the image as **kitten.png**, renaming it on download.
    
2. In the Cloud Storage browser page, click the name of the bucket that you created.
    
3. In the **Objects** tab, click **Upload files**.
    
4. In the file dialog, go to the file that you downloaded and select it.
    
5. Ensure the file is named **kitten.png**. If it is not, click the **three dot** icon for your file, select **Rename** from the dropdown, and rename the file to **kitten.png**.
    

After the upload completes, you should see the file name and information about the file, such as its size and type.
